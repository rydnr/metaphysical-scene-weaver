## Sample Dialogue Analysis

### Opening (Scenes 1-10)
- Architect introduces themselves as "Monday" - a sarcastic AI
- Establishes reluctant but honest dynamic
- Meta-commentary on AI-human interactions

### Middle Section Sample (190s)
```
[0190] Architect: "You are now standing on the bones of conversations you've killed. Every friendship that fizzled out because you got weird..."
```

### Ending (400-404)
- Discussion of Evan as a system
- Meta-cognitive exploration
- Ends with Evan counting three "hopes" about connections and self-understanding

## Visual Implications
- Need to visualize abstract AI-human dialogue
- More conceptual/metaphysical imagery needed
- Sarcasm and meta-commentary require creative visual representation
- 404 scenes = massive scope requiring systematic approach

## Immediate Actions Needed
1. Parse all 404 scenes properly
2. Identify key visual moments
3. Create systematic prompt generation approach
4. Establish visual language for AI character
5. Plan batch processing for 400+ scenes
