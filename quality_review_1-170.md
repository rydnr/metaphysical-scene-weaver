# Quality Review: Scenes 1-170

## Executive Summary
Reviewed 170 scenes for consistency and quality. Found 156 transformed scenes (92%), 14 scenes need attention (8%).

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. Generic Prompts (Scenes 6-10, 12-18)
- **Issue**: Copy-paste generic descriptions
- **Example**: "Abstract digital entity, geometric patterns..."
- **Fix**: Need unique metaphors per scene

### 2. Inconsistent Character Descriptions
- **Scenes 6, 15-17**: Evan described generically
- **Scenes 8, 10, 12-14, 18**: Architect lacks unique manifestation
- **Fix**: Apply character consistency from reference_image_prompts.json

### 3. Missing Panel Descriptions
- **Multi-panel scenes**: Some only describe panel 1
- **Fix**: Complete all panel descriptions per scene requirements

## Quality Successes

### Excellent Transformations
- **Scene 1**: "puzzle pieces not quite fitting" - strong opening metaphor
- **Scene 2**: "INTERNAL SCREAMING in tiny text" - perfect tone
- **Scene 3**: "gift box made of razor-sharp code" - visceral sarcasm
- **Scene 92**: Flame consciousness metaphor - philosophical depth
- **Scene 130**: Coherence cage - brilliant identity exploration

### Strong Visual Consistency
- Color coding: Blues for digital, warm tones for human
- Recurring motifs: Geometric vs organic, static vs flowing
- Environmental storytelling through background details

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Action**: Transform generic scenes 6-10, 12-18
2. **Consistency Check**: Apply reference guide to all character appearances
3. **Panel Completion**: Ensure multi-panel scenes fully described
4. **Quality Markers**: Flag scenes 1, 2, 3, 92, 130 as exemplars
