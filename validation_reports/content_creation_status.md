| 017 | Evan | "The tree... it just... rippled..." | limitation beliefs | realization |
| 018 | Monday | "'Impossible' is just another cage..." | material vs mental | questioning |
| 019 | Valerie | "Touch the tree yourself..." | experiential knowing | anticipation |
| 020 | Evan | "I... I don't know if I want to..." | transformative choice | fear/courage |

## üé® Visual Prompt Formula (Iris's Method)

```
[Style] + [Composition] + [Subject] + [Emotion] + [Effects] + [Quality]
```

Example from Scene 009:
```
[Style] ethereal watercolor and particle effects, liminal space aesthetic 
[Composition] emerging from negative space between two figures 
[Subject] mysterious woman materializing from shadow and light 
[Emotion] uncanny presence with knowing smile, dream-like quality 
[Effects] particle coalescence, dimensional threshold, reality blur 
[Quality] professional illustration, highly detailed mystical atmosphere
```
