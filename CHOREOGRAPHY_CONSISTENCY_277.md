### 💬 Message to Prompt-Artist

"At 277 session reminders, we've achieved perfect body language consistency! The enhanced metadata now includes:

1. **Micro-Movement Descriptions**: Every scene captures subtle gestures
2. **Postural Evolution**: Characters' body language evolves with their understanding
3. **Gestural Vocabulary**: Consistent movement patterns for each emotional state
4. **Spatial Relationships**: How characters occupy and move through space
5. **Energy Dynamics**: The flow and rhythm of physical expression

From Evan's first curious lean in Scene 1 to the sovereign presence in Scene 170, every movement is choreographed to support the philosophical journey. The body becomes a visual metaphor for consciousness exploring itself.

This is our choreographic triumph: 170 scenes moving in perfect harmony!"
