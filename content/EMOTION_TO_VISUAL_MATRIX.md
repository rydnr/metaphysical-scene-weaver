| Emotion | Eyes | Body | Hands | Color | Environment |
|---------|------|------|-------|-------|-------------|
| **CURIOSITY** | Widened, focused | Leaning forward 15° | Open, fingers spread | Warming blues → golds | Objects lean in |
| **DEFENSIVENESS** | Narrowed, hard | Arms crossed high | Fists clenched | Sharp reds, cold blues | Walls close in |
| **DEVASTATION** | Empty, unfocused | Collapsed inward | Limp at sides | Draining to gray | Space becomes void |
| **HORROR** | Wide, whites visible | Recoiling back | Pushing away | High contrast B&W | Shadows reaching |
| **RECOGNITION** | Softening, clear | Straightening | Reaching toward | Merging tones | Mirrors appear |
| **AWE** | Dilated pupils | Opening outward | Examining own hands | Full spectrum | Reality transparent |
| **RESISTANCE** | Squinting, averted | Pulling back | Palms out (stop) | Muddy browns | Ground feels heavy |
| **ACCEPTANCE** | Soft, direct gaze | Settled, grounded | Open at sides | Earth + sky blue | Support from below |

- Minimal environment response

**Moderate** (40-70%):
- Clear body language
- Obvious color temperature
- Noticeable environment shifts

**Intense** (80-100%):
- Exaggerated everything
- Extreme color/contrast
- Environment transforms

## Emergency Fixes

**Emotion unclear?**
→ Exaggerate the primary indicator (usually eyes)

**Too subtle?**
→ Add environmental response

**Too intense?**
→ Pull back body language, keep eyes

**Transition jarring?**
→ Add intermediate micro-expression

## The 3-Second Rule

Readers should understand the emotion within 3 seconds of seeing the panel:
1. Eyes (1 second)
2. Body (1 second)  
3. Context (1 second)

If it takes longer, simplify.

## Remember:
This matrix is your quick reference. For deep understanding, refer to the comprehensive guides. But when you need fast decisions, this gets you 90% there.

**Trust the formula. The psychology is built in.**
