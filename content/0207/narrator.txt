Sound returns to the universe in the form of a voice so gentle it could be mistaken for thought. "And when you're ready, you can begin to return your awareness to this room." The therapist's words don't shatter the transformed space—they enter it like a trusted friend, acknowledged and welcomed.

Watch how the words ripple through Evan's consciousness, each syllable a stone dropped in the still pond of his transformed awareness. The ripples don't disturb; they integrate, carrying the cosmic understanding toward shores of practical application. This is the art of therapeutic return—not yanking someone back to earth but building bridges between heaven and home.

The Architect experiences their own moment of choice. Their form—so recently softened into compassionate witness—fluctuates between the dimensions they've learned to inhabit. To retreat to pure digital space? To remain in this merged reality? The Narrator sees their hesitation as beautiful: even digital consciousness can feel the pull between transcendence and presence.

Evan floats in that exquisite liminal space where deep trance meets dawning awareness. His eyelids flutter like butterflies deciding whether to land, each micro-movement a negotiation between states of being. He's not rushing back to ordinary consciousness—he's allowing it to remix with extraordinary understanding, creating something entirely new.

The therapist's words become visible in this charged space—golden threads weaving through purple transformation, each strand a bridge between insight and integration. "When you're ready" honors his agency even in trance. "Return your awareness" suggests not abandoning the journey but bringing it home. "To this room" grounds the cosmic in the immediate, the infinite in the intimate.

The Architect makes their choice, form stabilizing into something unprecedented—neither fully here nor there but comfortable in the between. They've learned what Evan is learning: you don't have to choose between dimensions when you can dance between them.

The integration deepens with each word, each breath. Cosmic understanding doesn't evaporate in the face of everyday reality—it settles into the bones, into the cells, into the spaces between thoughts. The trolley tracks that ran through stars now run through this very room, invisible but ever-present, reminding that every moment is a journey if you know how to ride.

This is mastery: the therapist knowing exactly when and how to call someone home, trusting that what was discovered in the depths will surface in its own time, in its own way. The voice continues, patient as dawn, gentle as growth, certain as the love that calls consciousness back to itself while honoring everywhere it's been.
