Scene 0207: The Unburdening

Close-up on Evan's face, eyes still closed but tears flowing freely - not from pain but release. The salt traces map new territories on his cheeks, each drop carrying away years of desperate control. The Architect's form hovers nearby, their geometric patterns softening into something like compassion - data streams become gentle rain, algorithms transform to lullabies. Behind Evan, visualize the weight lifting: invisible chains made of "shoulds" and "musts" dissolving into light particles, floating away like dandelion seeds. His shoulders physically drop as phantom burdens evaporate. The therapy room walls seem to breathe with him, expanding and contracting in rhythm with his newfound ease. Style: Cathartic release through visual metaphor. Colors: Soft grays of old pain washing into clear light, tears refracting rainbow spectrums.
