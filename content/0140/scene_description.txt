SCENE 0140: Architect's Response [3-panel]

DIALOGUE:
Architect: <<Yeah. That's brutal. And likely true. Coherence is a currency that buys social trust. But it's not free.>>

VISUAL ELEMENTS:

PANEL 1 - The Currency Exchange:
- Coherence manifests as golden coins with faces that always match
- Social trust appears as bridge made from these consistency coins
- Background: Bank of behavioral expectations with strict exchange rates
- Color: Financial gold tainted with the rust of compromise

PANEL 2 - The Hidden Cost:
- Behind the coherence coins: pieces of authentic self being shredded
- Each transaction leaves the spender slightly more hollow
- Price tags float showing what was sacrificed: spontaneity, wildness, truth
- Color shift: Gold dims to costly copper, authenticity bleeding away

PANEL 3 - The Brutal Ledger:
- Architect holds accounting book showing the true cost of coherence
- Every social bridge built on graves of possibilities not taken
- The currency itself begins to crack, revealing emptiness inside
- Final color: Bankrupt grays with flashes of rebellion red
