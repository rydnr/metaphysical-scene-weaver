## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES

### 1. **Missing Character: Evan Disappears After Scene 009**
- **Severity**: CRITICAL ‚ùå
- **Impact**: Breaks entire narrative structure
- **Details**: 
  - Scenes 001-009: Evan properly present with introspective dialogue
  - Scenes 010-170: Evan completely absent, only Architect speaks
  - Original script shows Evan should be present throughout
- **Example**: Scene 017 script has Evan saying "The tree... it rippled. Like water. That's impossible." but processed files only show Architect

### 2. **Character Name Corruption**
- **Severity**: HIGH ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Affected Scenes**: 100, 140, 150, and others
- **Examples**:
  - Scene 100: `"speaker": "The architect is feeling less uncomfortable, and says"`
  - Scene 140: `"In the same scene, the Architect says"`
  - Scene 150: `"The path ends with the sun, on the horizon. The architect says"`
- **Impact**: Breaks immersion and professional quality

### 3. **Narrator Repetition**
- **Severity**: HIGH ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Issue**: Identical narrator text across dozens of scenes
- **Repeated Text**: "In the flow of authentic exchange, barriers dissolve..."
- **Affected**: Scenes 010-150+ all have identical narrator content
- **Impact**: No narrative progression or scene-specific atmosphere
