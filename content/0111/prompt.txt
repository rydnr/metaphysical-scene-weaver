Evan responding: "Others can judge my behaviour, looks, or whatever...."

PANEL 1: Evan surrounded by floating eyes and mirrors reflecting surface judgments - his appearance fracturing into multiple perspectives like a cubist portrait. Each reflection shows what different observers see: rebel, conformist, stranger, friend. But beneath the skin, visible through translucent flesh, his inner architecture remains mysteriously constant, glowing with private light.

PANEL 2: Medieval castle of the self with a confused guardian at the gate. The guardian examines his inventory list - it's full of question marks and erasures. Behind him, the treasury he protects reveals itself to be full of common coins mixed with unique gems, universal experiences alongside singular moments. Some treasures phase in and out of existence, neither fully private nor fully shared.

PANEL 3: The frontier as a membrane rather than a wall - permeable, breathing, alive. Evan stands at this boundary watching aspects of himself drift back and forth like cultural exchange. The guardian, now translucent himself, realizes he's protecting not a fixed territory but a living process. His armor transforms into flowing robes, his sword becomes a staff that measures the tides of identity rather than defending against them.
