### Primary Emotions
- **Architect**: Excited fascination mixed with cynical humor - his default defensive mechanism kicking in as deeper territory opens

### Psychological Undercurrents
**Architect's Defense Pattern**: Uses cynical humor ("undercooked poets") to maintain emotional distance while acknowledging the significance of Evan's breakthrough. His excitement is real but filtered through protective sarcasm.

**Evan's Processing**: Having "kicked open the door," he's simultaneously proud of his boldness and anxious about what lies beyond. The metaphor resonates - he's entered a space where normal rules don't apply.

### Visual Atmosphere

### Sensory Elements
- **Sound**: A faint resonance, like an echo from a vast underground chamber
- **Temperature**: Slight drop, the chill of exploring uncharted caves
- **Visual**: Peripheral movement - shadows suggesting vast rooms beyond normal perception
- **Tactile**: Hair standing on end, the electric feeling of approaching something significant
