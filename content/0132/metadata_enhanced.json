Armor dissolves into light particles, each revealing suppressed possibility. Shadow figures emerge - all the Evans never allowed to exist. Space between them forms text: 'The guardian was never protecting me FROM others, but protecting others FROM me.' Final frame: merging into one integrated being.",

The ultimate paradox: we protect others from our full possibility and call it self-protection. Freedom comes not from destroying the guardian but integrating it.",
