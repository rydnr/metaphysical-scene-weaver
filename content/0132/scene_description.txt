SCENE 0132: The Guardian's Paradox - Protection as Prison [2-panel] [FINAL TRANSFORMATION]

DIALOGUE:
Evan: <<Because I don't want to deal with the consequences. So, indirectly, the coherence my guardian is protecting is a limitation — at least with respect to others.">>

VISUAL ELEMENTS:

PANEL 1 - The Consequences Avalanche:
- Evan's guardian (from Scene 110) now shown exhausted, holding back an avalanche of "consequences"
- Each consequence visualized: confused friends, lost relationships, professional doubts, social exile
- The guardian's shield reads "Coherence" but cracks under the weight of what it prevents
- Behind the guardian, Evan's true self withers in the safety of limitation
- Sign posts show paths not taken: "Authentic but Alone," "Free but Misunderstood"
- The guardian whispers: "I protect you from freedom itself"

PANEL 2 - The Ultimate Recognition:
- The guardian and Evan finally face each other across a mirror that shows the truth
- The guardian removes their helmet, revealing they ARE Evan - his fear crystallized
- Between them, the armor of coherence begins to dissolve into light
- Each piece that falls reveals a possibility suppressed, a self unexpressed
- Other figures emerge from shadows - all the Evan's he could have been
- Text forms in the space between: "The guardian was never protecting me FROM others, but protecting others FROM me"

PHILOSOPHICAL THEME: The Final Paradox - How Self-Protection Becomes Self-Imprisonment

EMOTIONAL TONE: Heavy Recognition → Liberation's Edge
