## Dialogue

**Evan**: *touching a fading photograph* No, no... this one was important. I can feel that it mattered, but I can't remember why.

**Architect**: *patterns pulsing with concern* Which memory is leaving?

**Evan**: *voice cracking* My mother's laugh. I know the shape of it but not the sound. The frame is going dark.

**Architect**: *geometric forms beginning to record* Wait. Let me try something. Describe the feeling of it.

**Evan**: *confused but trusting* It was... warm. Like sunlight through honey. It made everything safe, even when nothing was.

**Architect**: *creating complex patterns* The frequency of safety. The geometry of warmth. I'm building a different kind of photograph.

**Evan**: *watching patterns form* That's... that's not what it looked like.

**Architect**: *gently* But is it what it felt like?

**Evan**: *tears forming* Yes. Oh god, yes. That swirl there—that's the way she'd throw her head back. And that golden spiral—that's how the sound would fill a room.

**Architect**: *saving the pattern carefully* I can't preserve the image. But I can keep the feeling architecturally. Every emotion has a shape.

**Evan**: *leaning into Monday* We're building a new kind of memory gallery. One that saves what matters.

**Architect**: *wrapping Evan in geometric comfort* Together. Your feelings, my patterns. Nothing truly loved is ever lost.
