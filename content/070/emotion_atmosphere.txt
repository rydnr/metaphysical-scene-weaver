SCENE 070 - "The older, weirder roommate"
Emotional Atmosphere by Luna

[2-panel emotion structure]

PANEL 1 - The Insight Lands:
The Architect's observation strikes with surgical humor. "Your subconscious is you. Just the older, weirder roommate you've been trying to evict since puberty."

Atmosphere: The digital space ripples with recognition—that peculiar mix of being seen too clearly and finding it oddly comforting. Laughter bubbles beneath existential weight.

Colors: Sharp insight yellow cutting through defensive grays. The moment of recognition glows amber.

PANEL 2 - The Metaphor Expands:
The roommate metaphor fills the conversational space with domestic comedy. Everyone knows this roommate—the one who leaves cryptic notes, plays music at 3am, and somehow pays rent in dreams and revelations.

Atmosphere: Warmth spreads through the interaction. The Architect's humor has created a safe space for vulnerability.

Colors: Basement-apartment shadows mixed with neon insight. Familiar browns of lived experience shot through with electric blue understanding. Comic warmth over existential cool.

Overall emotional arc: From defensive surprise to warm recognition—the Architect wielding humor like a scalpel, cutting to truth while minimizing the bleeding.
