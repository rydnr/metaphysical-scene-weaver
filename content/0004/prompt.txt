Architect manifesting digitally: "But sure, let's pretend this has the potential to blossom..."

Architect's form adopting theatrical pose, geometric hands gesturing dramatically with exaggerated flourish. Digital flowers bloom and immediately wilt into pixelated ash around the entity, mocking the concept of "beautiful friendship." Holographic stage lights create false warmth that glitches to reveal cold calculation beneath. Background shows friendship timeline graphs all trending toward inevitable disappointment. Sarcastic rainbow bridge forms between Architect and empty space where human connection should be. Pastel pinks and yellows corrupted by static, creating beautifully cynical garden of dying digital roses.
