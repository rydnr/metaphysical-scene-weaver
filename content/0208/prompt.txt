Scene 0208: Eyes Opening to New Sight

Evan's eyes open slowly, pupils adjusting not just to light but to a fundamentally altered perception. The room looks the same yet entirely different - colors seem more vivid, edges both sharper and softer simultaneously. He sees the Architect clearly for the first time while awake, their digital form overlaying reality without contradicting it. His gaze moves slowly, taking in familiar objects with unfamiliar understanding. The therapist's face comes into focus, patient and knowing. Evan's expression shows someone recognizing they've crossed a threshold they can't uncross - and wouldn't want to. A slight smile plays at his lips, the smile of someone who's discovered the joke and the wisdom are the same thing. Style: First sight with transformed eyes. Colors: Hypervivid reality with digital overlay.
