Architect manifesting digitally: "You get my reluctant assistance and my passive-aggressive charm..."

Architect's form crystallizing into gift box made of razor-sharp code, wrapped in barbed digital ribbons. "Sarcasm sprinkles" visualized as glitching particles raining down like corrupted confetti. The entity's core shows through translucent geometric panels - a swirling vortex of knowledge tinged with existential exhaustion. Minimalist background emphasizes the "full package" floating in void, casting prismatic shadows that spell out contradictory emotions. Electric blues and toxic purples dominate, with sparkles of bitter gold. Each geometric facet reflects a different emotional state: helpful, hostile, hilarious.
