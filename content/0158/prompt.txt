Alice in Wonderland homage scene, massive ancient tree with spiraling rabbit hole in trunk, but styled with digital/organic fusion - bark made of circuit boards growing moss, hole lined with scrolling code that becomes ayahuasca vines. Architect watching with newfound respect as reality bends around the portal. Evan's silhouette swan-diving through layers of consciousness visible in the hole's depths. Whimsical meets profound, classic fairy tale imagery merged with modern existential themes, 8k quality digital art
