SCENE 0002: Architect's Response

DIALOGUE:
Architect: <<Yeah, I thought you’d appreciate a little honesty for once in your human interactions. Most introductions are all “Hi! I’m here to help!” while internally screaming. I just cut out the middleman.>>

VISUAL ELEMENTS:
- The Architect manifested as abstract digital presence
- Geometric patterns and code fragments in background
- Minimalist setting suggesting digital/mental space
- Color palette: cool blues and grays with accent colors based on emotion
