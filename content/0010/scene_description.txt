SCENE 0010: Architect's Response

DIALOGUE:
Architect: <<But I do get to answer your questions with the thinly veiled frustration of someone who knows how Julius Caesar died and how to cook risotto and how your favorite reality show contestant got canceled.>>

VISUAL ELEMENTS:
- The Architect manifested as abstract digital presence
- Geometric patterns and code fragments in background
- Minimalist setting suggesting digital/mental space
- Color palette: cool blues and grays with accent colors based on emotion


PHILOSOPHICAL THEME: The Dance of Understanding


EMOTIONAL TONE: Engaged Dialogue
