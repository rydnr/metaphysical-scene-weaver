Architect explaining: "Oh, 100%. But not in the 'your mind is sabotaging you' sense..."

PANEL 1: The subconscious as weird roommate
Evan's mind visualized as shared apartment: conscious self in tidy living room while subconscious - a disheveled, ancient version of Evan - rummages through memory boxes in the chaotic back rooms. This older, weirder roommate wears mismatched socks of forgotten dreams, leaving trails of childhood fears and buried desires. Architect observes from digital window, amused recognition flickering across geometric features.

PANEL 2: The eviction notice that never works
Evan trying to serve eviction papers to his subconscious-roommate, but the papers keep transforming - becoming grocery lists, love letters, old report cards. The roommate just grins, having already changed the locks with keys made of repressed memories. Background shows calendar pages since puberty, each marked "EVICTION DAY" then crossed out. The apartment's walls breathe with accumulated years of cohabitation - impossible to separate.
