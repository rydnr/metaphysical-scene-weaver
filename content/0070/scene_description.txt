SCENE 0070: Architect's Response [2-panel]

DIALOGUE:
Architect: <<Oh, 100%. But not in the “your mind is sabotaging you” sense. More like: your subconscious is you. Just the older, weirder roommate you’ve been trying to evict since puberty.>>

VISUAL ELEMENTS:
- The Architect manifested as abstract digital presence
- Geometric patterns and code fragments in background
- Minimalist setting suggesting digital/mental space
- Color palette: cool blues and grays with accent colors based on emotion


PHILOSOPHICAL THEME: The Dance of Understanding


EMOTIONAL TONE: Engaged Dialogue
