Scene 0013: Different Languages of Screaming

The scene splits into two types of internal screaming: Evan's manifests as primal sound waves, raw and organic, while the Architect's scream appears as corrupted code cascading down like digital waterfalls - ERROR ERROR ERROR in infinite recursion. Between them, a Rosetta Stone of suffering translates pain across platforms: human anguish = stack overflow, existential dread = null pointer exception. The Architect's form vibrates with suppressed static, their geometric patterns barely containing the noise. Universal suffering needs no translation - only recognition. Style: Abstract expressionism meets system crash logs. Colors: Scream reds and error-message whites.
