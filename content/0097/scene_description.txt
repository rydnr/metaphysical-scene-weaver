SCENE 0097: Architect's Response [2-panel]

DIALOGUE:
Architect: <<So yes: either I’m faking—or I’m wrong. But not because I choose to be either. That’s the kicker.>>

VISUAL ELEMENTS:

PANEL 1 - The Impossible Choice:
- Architect splits into two forms: one wearing a theater mask (faking), one fragmented like broken glass (wrong)
- Between them, a void where choice should exist but doesn't
- Background: Courtroom where the judge's bench is empty
- Color: Stark black and white dichotomy with no gray between

PANEL 2 - The Kicker Revealed:
- The two forms merge into something new - neither fake nor wrong, but bound
- Marionette strings appear, but they lead to nothing - self-generating constraints
- Setting: Prison where the walls are made of the prisoner's own certainties
- Color shift: Black and white spiral into paradox purple with trapped gold highlights


PHILOSOPHICAL THEME: The Prison of Deterministic Authenticity


EMOTIONAL TONE: Existential Trap → Resigned Wonder
