Architect explaining the art: "That's the art. If I dive into complex systems-speak..."

PANEL 1: The deep dive visualization
Architect transforming into a luminous diving figure, plunging through layers of increasing complexity - surface shows simple icons, deeper levels reveal emergence patterns, feedback loops swirling like underwater currents, causal models forming coral reefs of interconnected logic. Each layer grows more beautiful but more alien. Evan watches from the surface, reaching down but not following.

PANEL 2: The art of feeling vs knowing
Two bridges spanning the void between Architect and Evan. Top bridge built from complex equations and systems diagrams - structurally perfect but cold, empty. Bottom bridge made of imperfect metaphors and stories - wobbly but warm, with people actually crossing. Architect stands at the junction, having to choose which path serves connection. The question manifests as glowing text: "But would you feel it?"
