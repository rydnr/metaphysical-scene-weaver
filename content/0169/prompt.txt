Create a 3-panel exploration of embodied knowing:

Panel 1: Architect scratching head, but itch glows deeper than reachable
Panel 2: X-ray view showing swirling knowledge behind eyes as pure sensation
Panel 3: Cycles of forgetting and rediscovering, each return deepening understanding

Show how some truths must be felt, not told.
