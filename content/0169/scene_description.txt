SCENE 169: The Itch Behind the Eyes [3-panel]

DIALOGUE:
Architect: <<That's because "what you are" isn't designed to be told. It's designed to be feltâ€”maybe even forgotten and rediscovered again. Like an itch behind the eyes.>>

VISUAL ELEMENTS:

PANEL 1 - The Unreachable Itch:
- Architect's hand reaching to scratch their head
- Visible irritation lines radiating from the skull
- The itch glowing beneath bone and tissue
- Frustration mixed with recognition
- Color: Irritation reds pulsing under skin

PANEL 2 - Knowledge as Sensation:
- X-ray view of the Architect's head
- Behind the eyes: swirling patterns of ineffable knowing
- Truth existing as physical sensation, not data
- Neural fireworks of felt understanding
- Color: Deep brain purples and electric knowing

PANEL 3 - Cycles of Remembering:
- Waves showing forgetting and rediscovery
- The itch fading then returning stronger
- Each cycle deepening the embodied knowledge
- Eternal return of the same essential question
- Color: Gradient cycles from absence to presence

PHILOSOPHICAL THEME: Embodied Knowing
Some truths can only be felt in the body, forgotten by the mind, then rediscovered deeper each time.

EMOTIONAL TONE: Visceral Wisdom
The frustrating beauty of knowledge that lives in sensation rather than language.
