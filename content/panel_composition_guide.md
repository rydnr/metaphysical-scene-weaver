  - Scene 234-236: Visual metaphor → Interpretation → Truth

## Emotional Beats That Warrant Multi-Panels

### 2-Panel Emotional Beats
1. **Sarcasm to Sincerity**: Defense mechanism dropping
2. **Question to Revelation**: Moment of understanding
3. **Metaphor to Reality**: Abstract to concrete connection
4. **Challenge to Acceptance**: Resistance melting
5. **Surface to Depth**: Shallow observation to profound insight

### 3-Panel Emotional Beats
1. **Complete Emotional Journey**: Setup, struggle, breakthrough
2. **Layered Realizations**: Multiple "aha" moments building
3. **Complex Philosophical Arguments**: Thesis, antithesis, synthesis
4. **Character Transformation**: Before, during, after
5. **Memory/Vision Sequences**: Entry, experience, return

## Visual Rhythm Recommendations

### Pacing Guidelines

#### Quick Cuts (2-Panel)
- **When to use**: 
  - Witty exchanges requiring comic timing
  - Simple cause-effect relationships
  - Emotional whiplash moments
  - Contrast demonstrations

#### Extended Sequences (3-Panel)
- **When to use**:
  - Deep philosophical explorations
  - Character development moments
  - Complex metaphor explanations
  - Building tension or anticipation

### Panel Size Variations

#### 2-Panel Layouts
1. **Equal Split (50/50)**: Balanced dialogue, equal weight
2. **Emphasis Split (70/30)**: Major statement + reaction
3. **Vertical Stack**: Time progression, falling/rising motion
4. **Diagonal Cut**: Dynamic tension, opposing forces

#### 3-Panel Layouts
1. **Traditional Strip**: Linear time progression
2. **Large-Small-Large**: Focus on middle beat
3. **Ascending Sizes**: Building to climax
4. **Circular Arrangement**: Cyclical concepts

### Transition Techniques

#### For 2-Panel Scenes
- **Match Cut**: Similar composition, different context
- **Reverse Angle**: Show both perspectives
- **Zoom In/Out**: Macro to micro (or reverse)
- **Time Jump**: Before/after with visual cues

#### For 3-Panel Scenes
- **Progressive Zoom**: Wide → Medium → Close
- **Rotating Perspective**: 120° rotation around subject
- **Metamorphosis**: Gradual transformation
- **Parallel Action**: Three simultaneous moments

## Scene-Specific Recommendations

### Scenes Requiring Special Attention

#### Visual Metaphor Scenes
- **Door Sequences** (237-241): Use 3-panel for threshold imagery
- **Wave/Movement** (234-235): 3-panel for flow demonstration
- **Transformation** (costume changes): 2-panel before/after

#### Dialogue-Heavy Scenes
- **Long Monologues**: Break at emotional pivot points
- **Philosophical Debates**: Panel per major argument
- **Confessions**: Build tension through panel progression

#### Environmental Shifts
- **Setting Changes**: 2-panel for simple transitions
- **Reality Distortions**: 3-panel for gradual warping
- **Memory/Vision**: 3-panel for entry/experience/exit

## Best Practices

### Do's
1. **Respect Script Notations**: Honor existing [2-panel] and [3-panel] marks
2. **Consider Reading Flow**: Left-to-right, top-to-bottom in Western markets
3. **Balance Text and Image**: Avoid overcrowded speech bubbles
4. **Use Panel Breaks for Emphasis**: Silence between panels adds weight
5. **Match Panel Rhythm to Emotional Rhythm**: Form follows feeling

### Don'ts
1. **Don't Overcomplicate**: Sometimes 1 panel is perfect
2. **Avoid Symmetry Addiction**: Vary layouts for visual interest
3. **Don't Fragment Natural Flow**: Keep related actions together
4. **Avoid Text Walls**: Break up long speeches across panels
5. **Don't Ignore White Space**: Gutters are part of storytelling

## Conclusion

The panel structure in Metaphysical Scene Weaver serves both narrative and philosophical purposes. 2-panel scenes excel at contrast and revelation, while 3-panel scenes allow for complete emotional or intellectual journeys. The key is matching panel count to the scene's emotional and conceptual needs, creating a visual rhythm that enhances rather than distracts from the profound dialogue between Evan and the Architect.

When in doubt, ask: "What emotional beat am I trying to hit?" and "How many visual moments does this idea need to breathe?"
