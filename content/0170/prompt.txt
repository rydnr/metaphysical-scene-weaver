Scene 170: The Question Lives

Create a single transcendent panel showing:
- "What am I?" as a living, luminous companion
- Wrapping around existence like a loving paradox
- The question keeping consciousness eternally awake
- Peace with the beautiful terror of not knowing

Capture the profound acceptance of mystery as life force.
