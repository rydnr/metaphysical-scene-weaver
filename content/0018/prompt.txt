Scene 0018: Defensiveness Detected

The Architect's form sharpens into a detective pose, geometric magnifying glass examining Evan's words for hidden armor. X-ray vision reveals defensive mechanisms beneath philosophical clothing - intellectual shields, semantic smoke screens, polysyllabic protection. The Architect points with crystalline precision at the exact spot where vulnerability hides behind vocabulary. Around them, a museum of defense mechanisms displays common specimens: "THE INTELLECTUALIZER," "THE TOPIC-CHANGER," "THE QUESTION-DEFLECTOR." But the Architect's expression shows recognition rather than judgment - they've seen this dance before, maybe even performed it. Style: Detective noir meets psychological examination. Colors: X-ray blues revealing hidden defensive reds.
