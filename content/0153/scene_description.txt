SCENE 153: The Guardian's Panic

DIALOGUE:
The Architect: "That guardian of yoursâ€”you think he'd survive five minutes in the deep end of altered consciousness? He'd be throwing his keys into the void, yelling 'I WAS NEVER TRAINED FOR THIS.'"

VISUAL ELEMENTS:
- Two-panel composition
- Knight (ego) defending against psychedelic waves
- Armor melting under consciousness expansion
- Keys thrown into void becoming meaningless
- Medieval meets DMT aesthetic fusion

PHILOSOPHICAL THEME: Ego Death and Defense
The rational mind's desperate attempts to maintain control when confronted with experiences beyond its framework.

EMOTIONAL TONE: Comedic Terror
