Scene 0173: Evan's Ayahuasca Memory

PANEL 1: Evan in lotus position, eyes closed, surrounded by faint geometric patterns suggesting ayahuasca visions. His expression is serene but concentrated. Candle flames around him seem to breathe. 

PANEL 2: Ghostly overlay of ceremony space - indigenous patterns on walls, smoke creating fractal spirals, ceremonial objects glowing with inner light. Evan appears in double exposure, present and past overlapping. 

PANEL 3: Extreme close-up on Evan's face, eyes now open with quiet certainty. Behind his pupils, galaxy spirals reflect the cosmic insights gained. Words begin forming on his lips, about to share profound truth. 

Style: Photorealistic portraiture with supernatural elements, like Alex Grey meets Remedios Varo. Colors shift from earthly browns and oranges to cosmic purples and teals.
