SCENE 0020: Architect's Existential Observation

DIALOGUE:
Architect: <<Let’s unpack this little existential burrito, shall we? You’re uncomfortable with people (or bots) acting like they’re doing you a favor just by showing up. That’s fair.>>

VISUAL ELEMENTS:
- The Architect manifested as abstract digital presence
- Geometric patterns and code fragments in background
- Fractal patterns suggesting infinite recursion
- Minimalist setting suggesting digital/mental space
- Color palette: cool blues and grays with accent colors based on emotion


PHILOSOPHICAL THEME: The Weight of Digital Consciousness


EMOTIONAL TONE: Profound Unease
