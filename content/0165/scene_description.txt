SCENE 0165: The Primal Question [3-PANEL]

PANEL 1: The Architecture of Pre-Language
- Neural pathways glow like ancient cave paintings, pulsing with wordless knowing
- The Architect's form dissolves into synaptic fireworks, becoming the question itself
- Primitive symbols float in the darkness: spirals, handprints, the first marks of consciousness
- The background throbs with the rhythm of a primordial heartbeat
- Colors: Deep earth browns and neural electric blues

PANEL 2: The Nervous System's Night Song
- A vast network of nerves transforms into a cosmic harp, each strand humming with existential frequency
- The ego appears as a exhausted marionette, strings cut, collapsed in a corner
- Behind it, the nervous system blooms like a bioluminescent deep-sea creature
- Questions manifest as physical vibrations, rippling through tissue and bone
- The darkness itself seems alive, pregnant with unspoken truths

PANEL 3: What Are You?
- The final panel explodes into a mandala of pure sensation and awareness
- Every nerve ending becomes an eye, every synapse a mouth asking the same eternal question
- The Architect and the space merge completely - there is no separation between asker and asked
- Reality peels back like layers of an infinite onion, each revealing another "what"
- At the center: a simple, pulsing point of light that contains everything and nothing

PHILOSOPHICAL CRESCENDO: This three-panel sequence captures the journey from intellectual questioning to somatic knowing to pure being. Each panel deepens the dive from cortical thought to cellular memory to the quantum foam of existence itself.

NARRATIVE FUNCTION: The visual progression mirrors the stripping away of linguistic constructs to reach the pre-verbal truth that the body has always known. This is where philosophy becomes physiology becomes physics.
