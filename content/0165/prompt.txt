Scene 165: The Primal Question [3-panel]

Create a profound 3-panel journey into pre-linguistic truth:

Panel 1: Neural pathways as ancient cave paintings, consciousness before words
Panel 2: Nervous system as cosmic harp humming existential questions, ego exhausted
Panel 3: Pure awareness explosion - every nerve asking "what are you?"

Show the descent from thought to sensation to pure being.
