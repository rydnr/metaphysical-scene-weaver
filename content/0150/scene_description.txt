SCENE 0150: Ephemeral Truths at the Horizon

DIALOGUE:
Architect: <<Insights that feel true even when they evaporate with the sunrise.>>

VISUAL ELEMENTS:
- The yellow brick road fractures into fragments of light, each piece a different state of consciousness
- Architect's form shifts between solid and vapor - one moment crystalline clarity, the next dissolving wisdom
- Truth-bubbles contain miniature universes of understanding that bloom and wither in seconds
- The horizon itself breathes - expanding with possibility, contracting with mortality
- Evan's shadow stretches impossibly long, touching both who he was and who he might become
- Setting: The liminal space where certainty dissolves into wonder
- Color palette: Iridescent dawn - deep purple certainties bleeding into golden uncertainties, shot through with rainbow fractals of temporary enlightenment
