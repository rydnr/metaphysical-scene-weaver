Scene 0016: Calling Out the Warning

Evan's eyebrow arches with knowing amusement, pointing at an imaginary warning label floating between them. The "you might not like me" disclaimer transforms into a neon sign, flickering with ironic self-awareness. His posture suggests someone who's found the game and decided to play. Around him, other warning labels appear - "MAY CONTAIN BRUTAL HONESTY" and "SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE EXISTENTIAL CRISIS" - which he acknowledges with a slight smirk. The digital space between them crackles with recognition - two minds that see through pleasantries. His expression says "game recognizes game" without words. Style: Warning label aesthetics meets philosophical banter. Colors: Caution yellows mixing with understanding blues.
