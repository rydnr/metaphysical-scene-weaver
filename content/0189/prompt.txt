Scene 0189: Truth About Control

The words "No control" manifest as broken steering wheels, snapped puppet strings, and shattered remote controls floating in space around Evan. His hypnotized form lies still while his consciousness in the trolley passes through a graveyard of failed attempts at control - each tombstone marking another illusion: "CONTROLLED MY CAREER," "CONTROLLED MY RELATIONSHIPS," "CONTROLLED MY THOUGHTS." The Architect watches from digital clouds, their form softening with unexpected empathy. The truth hits like a gentle catastrophe - liberation through acceptance of powerlessness.
