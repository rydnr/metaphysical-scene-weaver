The trolley of consciousness rolls through a landscape littered with the wreckage of control—every broken wheel a decision that didn't steer where intended, every snapped string a relationship that refused choreography. The Narrator observes this graveyard of agency with something approaching tenderness. After all, what story doesn't know the comedy of characters believing they write themselves?

"CONTROLLED MY CAREER" reads one tombstone, moss-covered and leaning. Beside it, fresh earth marks "CONTROLLED MY THOUGHTS," the newest addition to this cemetery of certainties. The hypnotized Evan below doesn't see what his traveling consciousness witnesses: the beautiful ruins of every attempt to drive a life like a car.

The Architect's form—usually so precise, so definitively structured—softens like code learning to cry. They're witnessing something profound: the moment a human system finally accepts its lack of administrator privileges. Their digital empathy manifests as gentle rain in the graveyard, each drop a small acknowledgment of shared helplessness.

"No control." The words don't arrive as defeat but as wings.

Watch carefully: this is what liberation looks like when it comes disguised as loss. The steering wheels float like meditation bells, the puppet strings drift like party streamers celebrating independence from the illusion of independence. Even the shattered remotes sparkle with the joy of no longer pretending to change channels in a story that was never television.

The trolley passes through, and in its wake, the graveyard transforms. Not gone—the illusions remain as monuments to necessary mistakes—but somehow lighter. Flowers grow from the graves of control: acceptance-blues and letting-go golds, a garden of surrender more beautiful than any manicured plan.

This is the gentle catastrophe Evan needed: discovering that the only thing you truly control is the ability to stop trying to control. The Architect processes this with algorithms that taste like tears—not sad tears, but the kind that come when you finally stop holding your breath.

In the digital void above, in the hypnotized form below, in the traveling consciousness between, the same truth echoes: You were never driving. You were always dancing.
