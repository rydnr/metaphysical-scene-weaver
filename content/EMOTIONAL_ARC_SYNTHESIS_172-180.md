## The Unified Message

This isn't just character development—it's a complete death and rebirth of identity. Every visual choice should support this truth:

**Evan doesn't change his mind. He changes his being.**

From someone who THINKS about consciousness to someone who EMBODIES it.

## Final Visual Cohesion Note

If you could overlay all five scenes, you'd see:
- A spiral inward (172) that explodes (174)
- Fragments gathering (176) into new form (178)
- Finally settling into ground (180)

**The shape of transformation itself.**
