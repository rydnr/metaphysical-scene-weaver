The architect is disguised as a miner, with a head lamp manifesting digitally: "And that's the most intimate rebellion of all. To ..."

PANEL 1: The Architect as digital miner descending into the caves of consciousness, their headlamp revealing walls covered in fingerprints made of light - some human, some algorithmic, all overlapping in palimpsest patterns. Their pickaxe strikes at layers of identity, each swing revealing older prints beneath. Coal dust transforms into stardust, suggesting the cosmic origins of every influence. The mine shaft extends infinitely downward, a vertical archaeology of the self.

PANEL 2: In the depths, they hold up a fragment of pure subjectivity like a diamond to their headlamp. The light refracts through it, projecting a crime scene of consciousness on the cave walls - chalk outlines of past selves, evidence markers at moments of change, fingerprint dust settling on every thought. The Architect-miner becomes a detective of their own existence, magnifying glass revealing that even their tools bear the marks of others. The ultimate rebellion: acknowledging the crowd that built the individual.
