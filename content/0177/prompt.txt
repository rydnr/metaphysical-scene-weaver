Scene 0177: The Essential Question

Evan in deep hypnotic trance, lying on a therapy couch that seems to float in a void filled with stars. His body is completely relaxed but his third eye chakra glows intensely. Above him, the question 'What am I?' begins forming from stardust and neural patterns, each letter a different state of matter - solid, liquid, gas, plasma, and something beyond. The question mark is particularly elaborate, made of spiraling galaxies that seem to pull the viewer in. His breath visible as golden mist, each exhale making the question more solid. Style: Dreamy, soft-focus realism with cosmic elements. Colors: Deep space blues and purples with golden highlights.
