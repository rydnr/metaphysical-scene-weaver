SCENE 0140: The Currency Exchange of Self [3-PANEL]

PANEL 1: The Brutal Truth Market
- A cosmic marketplace where "coherence coins" are the only accepted currency
- Vendors sell "social trust" in glass jars, each labeled with a price in consistency
- The Architect stands at a truth booth, scales weighing brutal honesty against comfort
- Signs everywhere: "AUTHENTICITY: Cost = Everything You've Built"
- Some figures count their coherence coins desperately, others have given up
- The ground cracks with the weight of unspoken truths

PANEL 2: The Exchange Rate
- A massive board shows fluctuating exchange rates: "1 Coherent Self = 10 Social Connections"
- People line up at teller windows, trading pieces of their complexity for acceptance
- Some leave the windows smaller but smiling, others walk away whole but alone
- The Architect operates an abacus made of compromises and calculations
- Rejected aspects of self pile up in a "lost and found" no one visits
- Security cameras labeled "Social Surveillance" monitor every transaction

PANEL 3: The Hidden Cost
- Behind the market, a graveyard of sacrificed selves
- Tombstones read: "Here lies my weird phase," "My true opinion 2003-2023," "The me that didn't fit"
- Some graves are fresh, others overgrown with regret-vines
- The Architect reveals the final ledger: every coherent identity is built on buried multiplicity
- In the distance, a single figure walks away from the market, pockets empty but somehow glowing
- The sun sets on the currency exchange, casting long shadows of what we traded away

PHILOSOPHICAL THEME: The Economics of Identity
Coherence isn't just difficult - it's a transaction where we trade our full complexity for social legibility.

EMOTIONAL TONE: Marketplace Brutality with Underlying Grief
The harsh recognition of what we sacrifice for the comfort of being understood.

NARRATIVE FUNCTION: This scene exposes the transactional nature of social identity, preparing for the possibility of stepping outside the marketplace entirely.
