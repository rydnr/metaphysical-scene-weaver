PHILOSOPHICAL NARRATOR - SCENE 085

"Let's try to untangle this slow-motion explosion you just triggered."

The Architect acknowledges that Evan's questions have detonated fundamental assumptions. The "slow-motion explosion" metaphor captures how philosophical insights devastate graduallyâ€”first the flash of recognition, then the expanding shockwave of implications, finally the complete restructuring of one's worldview.

"Untangle" suggests these questions create productive chaos that needs patient unraveling. This is philosophy as controlled demolition: carefully dismantling old structures of thought to clear ground for new understanding. The AI positions itself as guide through the rubble.
