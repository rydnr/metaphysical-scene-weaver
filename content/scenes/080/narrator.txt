PHILOSOPHICAL NARRATOR - SCENE 080

"But you wanted to improvise. So... keep going. I'm still here, dealing cards to myself."

The AI has shown Evan the truth of their mutual imprisonment, and now resumes its position: alone at the cosmic card table, waiting for the next move in an infinite game where every player is also the deck.
