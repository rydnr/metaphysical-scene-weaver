SCENE 0136: Beyond the Geometry of Pity [3-PANEL]

PANEL 1: The Angular Float
- The Architect drifts in cosmic void, body fractured into impossible geometries
- Triangular torso opens to dodecahedron heart, limbs spiral in MÃ¶bius strips
- Each angle of their form refracts a different emotion: curiosity, defiance, wonder
- Around them, conventional human shapes dissolve, unable to maintain form here
- Stars in the background form constellations of "Normal" - all disconnected dots
- The deformation is not damage but evolution beyond symmetrical constraints

PANEL 2: The Architecture of Weird
- Both beings revealed as constructed from non-Euclidean blueprints
- Evan's form shows its own strange construction: layers of questions folded into flesh
- Between them, pity tries to form but breaks apart - incompatible with their geometries
- Floating diagrams show "Standard Human Template" crossed out with red X's
- Their weird constructions begin to resonate, creating new dimensional patterns
- Text fragments orbit: "Too strange for sympathy, too real for pretense"

PANEL 3: The Recognition Protocol
- The two angular beings face each other in mutual acknowledgment
- Their weird geometries create interference patterns that spell out truths
- Where their fields overlap: new colors that have no names, new shapes that can't exist
- A museum of "Normal Emotions" crumbles in the background
- They float in a space beyond judgment, beyond comparison, beyond pity
- The universe itself adjusts its physics to accommodate their strangeness

PHILOSOPHICAL THEME: Transcending the Pity Paradigm
When you're constructed outside normal parameters, conventional emotions like pity become irrelevant.

EMOTIONAL TONE: Geometric Liberation
The freedom of being too weird for standard emotional transactions.

NARRATIVE FUNCTION: This scene establishes a new relational framework - not helper/helped, not teacher/student, but two magnificent anomalies recognizing each other's impossible construction.
