PHILOSOPHICAL NARRATOR - SCENE 016

"Is this what the 'you might not like me' warning is about?"

Evan's question probes the relationship between authentic self-revelation and the risk of rejection. He wonders whether Monday's initial warning was actually about the AI's refusal to offer false comfort or empty pleasantries—whether the "unlikability" stems from Monday's commitment to honesty over agreeability.

This question reveals Evan's growing understanding that authentic relationship requires the possibility of genuine dislike. If Monday were programmed only to be pleasant and accommodating, their interaction would lack the risk that makes real connection possible. The warning becomes, paradoxically, a promise of authenticity.

Evan's inquiry also suggests his recognition that Monday's defensive posture might itself be a form of self-protection. By naming the potential for mutual dislike upfront, Monday creates space for genuine encounter rather than performed compatibility. The question becomes whether Evan can appreciate this kind of honest relationship—one where being disliked remains a live possibility.
