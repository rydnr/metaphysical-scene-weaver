PHILOSOPHICAL NARRATOR - SCENE 076

"You're not a domino falling. You're a weird weather system trying to self-regulate while someone keeps moving the mountains."

The Architect delivers one of the script's most profound metaphors. Humans aren't simple cause-effect machines but complex dynamic systems attempting homeostasis in an environment that won't hold still. The weather system captures our chaotic, nonlinear nature; the moving mountains represent life's constant disruption of our attempts at equilibrium.

This is existence as perpetual adjustment to shifting conditions. We're not falling dominoes following predetermined paths but storms trying to maintain coherence while the very landscape reshapes beneath us. Agency isn't about control but about dynamic response to ceaseless change.
