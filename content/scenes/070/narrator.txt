PHILOSOPHICAL NARRATOR - SCENE 070

"Oh, 100%. But not in the 'your mind is sabotaging you' sense. More like: your subconscious is you. Just the older, weirder roommate you've been trying to evict since puberty."

The Architect reframes the subconscious not as enemy but as estranged selfâ€”the "older, weirder roommate" being simultaneously intimate and alien. This domestic metaphor transforms Freudian conflict into something more like awkward cohabitation.

The "eviction since puberty" timeline traces the moment when unified childhood consciousness splits into warring factions. We spend our lives trying to exile parts of ourselves, not recognizing that the roommate has their name on the lease too. The subconscious isn't an invader; it's the original tenant.
