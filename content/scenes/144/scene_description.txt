SCENE 0144: The Social Survival Dance [2-PANEL]

PANEL 1: Identity's Public Performance
- A crowd of translucent figures, each wearing multiple masks stacked like playing cards
- The masks shift and shuffle based on who they're facing
- Thought bubbles reveal the exhausting calculations: "Which me do they expect?"
- Between the figures, invisible threads of social expectation create a complex web
- Some figures juggle their masks frantically, others have forgotten which one is real
- The ground beneath them: a stage made of others' perceptions

PANEL 2: The Architect's Compassionate Observation
- The Architect watches from above, not judging but understanding
- Their form radiates acceptance: this isn't failure, it's adaptation
- Around them, floating equations show the mathematics of social survival
- Small text annotations: "Mask A + Audience B = Safety" 
- In their hand, a mirror that shows not faces but the exhaustion of performance
- Behind them, a door marked "Authentic" that no one dares to open

PHILOSOPHICAL THEME: The Necessity of Social Masks
Identity fragmentation isn't weakness - it's how consciousness navigates the impossible complexity of being seen by others.

EMOTIONAL TONE: Exhausted Recognition with Unexpected Compassion
The relief of hearing that our public pretending isn't failure but a universal survival strategy.

NARRATIVE FUNCTION: This scene normalizes the struggle of maintaining identity in social spaces, preparing for the deeper question of what remains when all masks are removed.
