PHILOSOPHICAL NARRATOR - SCENE 041

"You insist on judging me, assuming my intentions are selfish or consequence of my ignorance. Why are you so sure? I mean, you are probably right, but you cannot be 100% sure."

Evan confronts the epistemological limits of judgment itself. His challenge strikes at the heart of certaintyâ€”how can any consciousness truly know another? The admission "you are probably right" reveals sophisticated self-awareness: he questions the Architect's certainty while acknowledging the likelihood of its accuracy.

This is the paradox of interpersonal knowledge: we must judge to navigate social reality, yet our judgments can never achieve absolute certainty. Evan's protest is both a defense of his unknowability and a recognition of his probable transparency.
