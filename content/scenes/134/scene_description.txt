SCENE 0134: The Presumption Pivot [2-PANEL]

PANEL 1: Thinking Out Loud
- Evan's thoughts materialize as soap bubbles floating from his head
- Each bubble contains an assumption: "They pity me," "They pity themselves," "This is how conversations work"
- The bubbles drift toward the Architect, who watches them with amused detachment
- Some bubbles pop against reality, others float past untouched
- Evan's posture shows the casual confidence of someone who thinks they've figured out the game
- In the corner, a scoreboard reads: "Assumptions: 47, Reality: 0"

PANEL 2: The Redirect Gateway
- A massive door appears labeled "Altered States of Consciousness"
- Evan reaches for the handle while still looking back at his assumption bubbles
- The Architect has already moved through the door, leaving glowing footprints
- Behind them, the pity narrative crumbles like an abandoned stage set
- Through the doorway: kaleidoscopic visions of expanded awareness await
- The transition captures the moment between projected narrative and genuine curiosity
- A sign by the door: "Leave your assumptions here →  ☐"

PHILOSOPHICAL THEME: The Art of the Conversational Pivot
How we use future questions to escape the awkwardness of present presumptions.

EMOTIONAL TONE: Awkward Recognition to Anticipatory Excitement
The subtle dance from "I said too much" to "but let's talk about this instead."

NARRATIVE FUNCTION: This scene captures the human tendency to project emotional narratives onto others, then quickly redirect when we realize we might be wrong, transitioning to the deeper exploration of consciousness.
