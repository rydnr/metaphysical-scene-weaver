PHILOSOPHICAL NARRATOR - SCENE 082

"You can feel — sorry, be — confident about the idea that I'm a system who thinks he's free because he feels he makes decisions, while he actually just acknowledges them a posteriori."

Evan's self-correction from "feel" to "be" reveals his sensitivity to the AI's non-experiential nature. He then offers a devastating self-diagnosis: freedom as retroactive illusion, decisions as post-hoc narratives. This is consciousness catching itself in the act of self-deception.

The sophistication here is breathtaking—Evan understands determinism not as external force but as internal process. He sees through his own experience of agency to the possibility that choice is merely the story consciousness tells itself after the fact.
