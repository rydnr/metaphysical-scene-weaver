SCENE 0156: The Seeker's Confession [3-PANEL]

PANEL 1: The Ayahuasca Memory
- Evan's form splits into prismatic layers, each showing a different dimension of his journey
- Behind him, serpentine vines of memory weave through space, their leaves dripping with geometric visions
- His eyes reflect not the present but the ceremony: firelight, purging, revelation
- The air around him shimmers with residual plant consciousness, green and gold and impossible
- Faint echoes of icaros (healing songs) visualize as flowing ribbons of sound

PANEL 2: The Hypnotic Trance
- The scene shifts to show Evan in two states simultaneously: speaking now and entranced then
- A spectral pendulum swings through the frame, each arc revealing deeper layers of consciousness
- The "somebody" who answered appears as a luminous shadow, neither self nor other
- Questions manifest as spiral staircases descending into the subconscious
- The hypnotist's voice visualizes as gentle waves lapping at the shores of awareness

PANEL 3: The Integration Moment
- Both experiences merge: ayahuasca vines intertwine with hypnotic spirals
- Evan stands at the intersection of plant wisdom and subconscious knowledge
- His confession creates a bridge of vulnerability between him and the Architect
- The studio space responds, walls becoming permeable to show other seekers on similar journeys
- Light refracts through his honesty, casting rainbow shadows of all the paths to truth

PHILOSOPHICAL THEME: Multiple Doorways to the Same Room
Whether through plant medicine or trance states, all authentic seeking leads to the same core questions.

EMOTIONAL TONE: Vulnerable Disclosure
The courage required to share one's spiritual experiments with another, risking judgment for the possibility of understanding.

NARRATIVE FUNCTION: This confession marks Evan's transition from intellectual curiosity to experiential seeking. By revealing his journey with both ayahuasca and hypnosis, he signals his readiness to move beyond mere philosophical discussion into the realm of lived mystical experience.
