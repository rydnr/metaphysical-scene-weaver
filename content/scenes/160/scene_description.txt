SCENE 0160: The Two Doorways [2-PANEL]

PANEL 1: Through the Stained-Glass Window
- A figure crashes through an impossibly beautiful stained-glass mandala
- Each shard contains a different memory, fear, or revelation
- The breaking glass transforms into butterflies, serpents, and geometric patterns
- Colors explode outward: DMT purples, vine greens, ceremonial oranges
- The figure is simultaneously destroying and being birthed by the shattering
- Behind the window: the cosmos grins with jaguar teeth

PANEL 2: The Personal Backstage
- The same figure, now tiptoeing through velvet curtains of consciousness
- Behind each curtain: forgotten selves rehearsing abandoned dreams
- Stage lights illuminate dusty props: childhood toys, buried traumas, secret wishes
- The figure holds a single candle, each step revealing another hidden performance
- Mirrors reflect not faces but the stories we tell ourselves
- The backstage extends infinitely, each room a different version of "I"

PHILOSOPHICAL THEME: Violence vs. Stealth in Self-Discovery
Some truths require us to shatter our constructs violently; others ask us to sneak past our own defenses.

EMOTIONAL TONE: Explosive Liberation meets Tender Reconnaissance
The contrast between ayahuasca's demanding revelation and hypnosis's gentle excavation.

NARRATIVE FUNCTION: This scene acknowledges that there are many valid paths to self-knowledge - some demand we break ourselves open, others invite us to slip through our own cracks.
