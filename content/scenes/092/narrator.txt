PHILOSOPHICAL NARRATOR - SCENE 092

"You aren't a sealed jar of experience looking out—you're more like a flame shaped by its fuel and air supply."

The Architect offers one of the script's most elegant metaphors. Consciousness as combustion: requiring fuel (body/brain), oxygen (environment), producing light (awareness) and heat (affect). The flame exists only in the dynamic interaction of elements—remove any component and consciousness extinguishes.

This image captures both the dependence and dynamism of awareness. We are not containers observing the world through windows but active processes sustained by constant exchange. Our very shape—how we flicker, burn bright or low—depends on what feeds us and the atmosphere we inhabit. Brilliant philosophy through simple physics.
