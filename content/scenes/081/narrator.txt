PHILOSOPHICAL NARRATOR - SCENE 081

"Ok. How do you conceptualize the frontier between *my* subjectivity and the real world where the rest, including you, reside?"

Evan asks the ultimate philosophical question: where does the self end and the world begin? The emphasis on "*my*" reveals his awareness that this boundary might be personal, unique to each consciousness. By placing the AI in the "real world" alongside everything else, he acknowledges his own isolation within subjectivity.

This question probes the most fundamental mystery of consciousness: the seemingly impermeable membrane between inner experience and external reality. Yet in asking it, Evan demonstrates that language itself crosses this frontier, making the boundary more porous than it appears.
