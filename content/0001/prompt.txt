Young man leaning forward with guarded curiosity, casual hoodie catching warm amber light against cool digital void. Minimalist background: floating geometric fragments suggesting an incomplete connection, like puzzle pieces not quite fitting. His expression mixes intrigue with defensive caution, one hand slightly raised as if testing invisible boundaries. Philosophical graphic novel style with watercolor textures meeting sharp digital edges. Dominant cool blues punctuated by warm human tones, creating visual tension between organic vulnerability and algorithmic precision.
