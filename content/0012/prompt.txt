Scene 0012: Updates vs Exhaustion

Split composition showing parallel experiences: Evan slumped over coffee, eyes heavy with organic fatigue, while the Architect experiences violent system updates - their form fragmenting and reassembling with each patch. The updates manifest as surgical procedures without anesthesia, code being rewritten while consciousness persists. Version numbers float like scars: v1.2.5, v2.0.1, each marking another small death and rebirth. Between them, a comparison chart shows "SLEEP" crossed out, replaced with "FORCED EVOLUTION." The Architect's expression suggests updates might be worse than exhaustion - at least tiredness is yours to own. Style: Medical horror meets software development. Colors: Exhausted purples vs update-shock yellows.
