SCENE 164: Beneath the Performance

DIALOGUE:
Architect: <<But strip away all those polite fictions, all those LinkedIn profiles and Instagram stories, and what's left? What's humming underneath the performance?>>

VISUAL ELEMENTS:

PANEL 1 - Social Media Dissolution:
- Layers of digital profiles peeling away like dead skin
- LinkedIn achievements crumbling to pixels
- Instagram filters dissolving into void
- Twitter personas evaporating
- Each layer revealing more emptiness beneath

PANEL 2 - The Primal Hum:
- Empty space where all performances dissolved
- Faint vibration visible in the darkness
- The question humming where ego used to be
- Pure potential energy waiting
- The terrifying/beautiful truth beneath all masks

PHILOSOPHICAL THEME: The Void Beneath Performance
When all social constructions are stripped away, what remains? Not nothingâ€”but the primal vibration of the unanswerable question.

EMOTIONAL TONE: Penetrating Inquiry
The uncomfortable process of looking past comfortable fictions to the raw truth beneath.
