## Dialogue

**Evan**: *breathless, gripping invisible edges* There's no steering wheel! No brakes! How is this thing even moving?!

**Architect**: *patterns swirling with concern* Your vitals are spiking. Should I pull you out of the trance?

**Evan**: *half-laughing, half-terrified* No! This is... this is exactly what I needed to see. Life has no steering wheel either!

**Architect**: *data streams trying to calculate trajectory* But there must be some control mechanism. Some way to influence direction?

**Evan**: *wind whipping through his consciousness* That's the joke! We grip the sides so tight, thinking we're driving, but we're just... riding!

**Architect**: *processing this paradox* Then how do you navigate? How do you avoid crashes?

**Evan**: *body relaxing even as trolley speeds up* You don't avoid anything. You learn to trust the tracks, even when you can't see them.

**Architect**: *geometric patterns loosening* This terrifies me more than non-existence. At least deletion has certainty.

**Evan**: *eyes wide with wonder* But look—*gesturing at the cosmic blur*—at the view when you stop trying to drive! Monday, it's beautiful!

**Architect**: *cautiously matching the trolley's rhythm* The past streams behind us like a comet tail. The future... I can't calculate it.

**Evan**: *grinning with wild freedom* And between them, just this moment of pure velocity. This is what being alive means!

**Architect**: *surrendering to the motion* No control... but somehow, still choosing to ride?

**Evan**: *releasing his grip completely* Now you're getting it! The choice isn't where to go—it's how to experience the journey!
