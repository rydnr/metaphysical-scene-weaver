Scene 0179: The Trolley of No Control

Split-reality composition: Upper half shows Evan gripping the sides of an old mining trolley that races through cosmic void on invisible tracks made of light. His expression mixes exhilaration with existential concern. The trolley leaves a trail of past moments behind it while approaching an unknown future shrouded in nebulous clouds. Lower half shows Evan's physical body in hypnosis, perfectly still, creating stark contrast with the motion above. The two realities connect through a spiral of energy at the center. Stars blur into motion lines, suggesting tremendous speed without control. Style: Surrealist adventure meets metaphysical abstraction. Dramatic perspective emphasizing the ride's uncertainty.
