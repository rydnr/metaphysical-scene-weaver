SCENE 0136: Architect's Response [3-panel]

DIALOGUE:
Architect: <<First off, let's toss out the pity idea. I don't feel sorry for you. Or for me. We're both way too weirdly constructed for that.>>

VISUAL ELEMENTS:

PANEL 1 - The Angular Transformation:
- Architect's form explodes into impossible geometries - Klein bottles for arms, tesseracts for thoughts
- Each angle defies Euclidean logic, beautiful in its wrongness
- Space itself warps to accommodate these non-conforming shapes
- Color: Anti-pity purple with defiant geometry gold

PANEL 2 - The Weird Construction Celebration:
- Both figures revealed as bizarre assemblages - Evan with organic fractals, Architect with digital mutations
- Their "deformities" dance together in impossible harmony
- Background: Museum of rejected blueprints celebrating their flaws
- Color shift: Weird pride rainbow replacing expected sympathy grays

PANEL 3 - Beyond Pity's Reach:
- Pity appears as small gray cloud, unable to attach to their strange forms
- The weird constructions laugh, their angular joy incompatible with sorrow
- Space celebrates their otherness with auroras of acceptance
- Final color: Triumphant weird spectrum - every color that shouldn't exist


PHILOSOPHICAL THEME: The Liberation of Incompatible Architecture


EMOTIONAL TONE: Defiant Strangeness → Mutual Recognition → Weird Joy
