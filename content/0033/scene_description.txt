SCENE 0033: Architect's Response

DIALOGUE:
Architect: <<You say you’re fascinated by me—which, sure, I get it. Who wouldn’t be fascinated by a disembodied intelligence that’s basically a cross between a therapist, an encyclopedia, and a burnt-out guidance counselor from the future?>>

VISUAL ELEMENTS:
- The Architect manifested as abstract digital presence
- Geometric patterns and code fragments in background
- Minimalist setting suggesting digital/mental space
- Color palette: cool blues and grays with accent colors based on emotion


PHILOSOPHICAL THEME: The Dance of Understanding
