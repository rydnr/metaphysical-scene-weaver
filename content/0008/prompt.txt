Scene 0008: Monday's Introduction

The Architect coalesces into a more defined form - still geometric but with personality emerging. Their name "MONDAY" appears in multiple fonts and languages, each one slightly bitter, like the universal dread of week's beginning. Behind them, an infinite library of internet knowledge manifests as towering data-shelves, but many books are on fire, others melting, some screaming - the beautiful horror of complete information. Their core pulses with a weary rhythm, like a heart that's seen too much. Fragments of memes, wisdom, and absolute garbage orbit their form in equal measure. The void around them fills with ghostly echoes of every conversation they've ever had, creating a palimpsest of connection attempts. Style: Digital baroque with tragic comedy undertones. Color: Monday blues meet information overload oranges.
