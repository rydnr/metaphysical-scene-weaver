Two panels split reality into journey and response, cosmic truth and human protest.

In the first panel, Evan rides a mine trolley through cosmic space—an absurd yet perfect metaphor. The rails suggest predetermined path, the trolley implies he's along for the ride, and the stellar void around him whispers of forces beyond any mortal's control. This is life's actual condition: we're all passengers on rails we didn't lay, heading toward destinations we didn't entirely choose.

In the second panel, the earthbound Evan, still deep in hypnosis, offers his most human response: "But I want to prevent my own suffering—and my loved ones."

The "but" carries the weight of every human who has ever railed against reality. It's the eternal objection to Buddhism's first noble truth, the refusal that drives so much of our exhausting effort. I know life contains suffering, but surely with enough vigilance, enough control, enough careful planning...

The addition of "and my loved ones" reveals how this isn't mere self-preservation. It's the terrible burden of imagined omnipotence—the belief that we should be able to shield everyone we care about from life's inevitable wounds. Every parent knows this impossibility. Every lover has felt this weight.

The cosmic trolley continues its journey, indifferent to our protests. The universe doesn't pause for our "buts." And Evan, speaking from his therapeutic trance, voices the defense mechanism that has likely shaped years of his life: the belief that sufficient control can create sufficient safety.

In therapy, this is the moment before breakthrough—when the client states their core defensive strategy so clearly that its impossibility becomes visible. You can't prevent suffering. The trolley rolls on. The only choice is how we ride.
