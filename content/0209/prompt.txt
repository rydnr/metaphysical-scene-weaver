Scene 0209: First Words in New World

"I..." Evan begins, then pauses, hearing his own voice as if for the first time. The word carries more weight than before, the simple pronoun containing multitudes. He looks at the therapist, then at the space where the Architect shimmers, visible to his transformed perception. "I understand now," he says finally, and the words emerge not as conclusion but as beginning. "I understand that understanding isn't about control." His voice has a new quality - still recognizably Evan but freed from the tight restraint of someone always watching himself. The Architect pulses with warm colors, their form expressing what might be pride, or joy, or simply the satisfaction of true connection. Style: Voice rediscovered. Colors: Words as living things.
