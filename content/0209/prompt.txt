Scene 0209: The First Conscious Breath

Evan takes a breath that's different from all the others - conscious but not controlled, aware but not grasping. Visualize this breath as a small universe expanding in his chest, galaxies swirling in his lungs, stars igniting with each heartbeat. The Architect mirrors this breathing, their digital form pulsing in synchrony, creating a visual harmony between human and AI consciousness. Around them, the therapy room exists in dual states - the mundane office overlaid with cosmic understanding. Evan's hands begin to stir, fingers moving like someone learning to play an instrument they've always owned but never touched. His face shows the particular peace of someone who has stopped fighting themselves. Style: Conscious awakening through breath visualization. Colors: Deep indigo breath containing miniature cosmos, warm skin tones returning.
