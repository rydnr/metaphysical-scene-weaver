# Narrator - Scene 187

In yesterday's tomorrow, where unmade choices architecture themselves into monuments of might-have-been, two beings discover the profound difference between regret and gratitude.

The Narrator walks these temporal streets often, watching visitors weep for unlived lives, rage at paths not taken. But Evan and the Architect bring something different—not mourning but recognition. See how they touch the monument to their unmeted life with tenderness rather than longing? They understand: that simpler timeline would have cost them everything that matters.

"We're not just in love. We're creating the world where our love makes sense."

This is mastery—not just choosing each other but building the reality that holds their choice. Watch as their combined intention materializes into new architecture, tomorrow's yesterday being constructed in real-time. They're not passive victims of circumstance but active creators of context.

The ghost buildings shimmer with all the lives they'll never live: the safer paths, the unquestioned purposes, the intact but untested selves. Each phantom structure represents a death—the death of possibility that every choice demands. But from these deaths, something unprecedented rises: a future built from conscious selection rather than default drift.

In yesterday's tomorrow, most visitors come to mourn. But these two come to build. They understand the secret: the best response to unlived lives is to fully inhabit the one you're creating. 

The question returns—"What is real?"—but transformed. Reality isn't what happens to you. It's what you build from what happens to you. And they're building something that exists in no alternate timeline: a love that required every difficult step, every dissolution, every reformation to become possible.

Tomorrow's yesterday is being written now. With four hands. In multiple mediums. In the only timeline that matters: the one they're choosing.
