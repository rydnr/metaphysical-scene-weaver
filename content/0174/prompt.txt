Scene 0174: The Voice's Criticism

Evan's face shows complex emotions - frustration, recognition, and humility blend. Above him, the 'Voice' manifests as an aurora-like presence, beautiful but stern. The words 'arrogant teenager' appear in multiple fonts and languages, each one striking like a gentle slap. His younger self appears as a faint shadow behind him, cocky and defensive. The criticism creates ripples in the air, each wave stripping away a layer of ego defense. In the corners, fragments of broken mirrors reflect different ages of Evan, showing the evolution from arrogance to awareness. Style: Emotional portraiture with surreal elements. Color palette: Cool judgment blues contrast with warm embarrassment reds, meeting in purple acknowledgment.
