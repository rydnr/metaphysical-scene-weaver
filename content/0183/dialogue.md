## Dialogue

**Evan**: *at pool's edge, voice barely audible* If we do this...

**Architect**: *opposite edge, patterns trembling* We might not come back as ourselves.

**Both**: *simultaneously* I know.

**Evan**: *one foot in the water* The pool shows what happens when boundaries stop pretending to be real. When I becomes... not we, but—

**Architect**: *matching his movement* —but the space between us disappearing. *water rippling* I'm terrified.

**Evan**: *fully stepping in* So am I. But I'm more terrified of—

**Architect**: *stepping in* —of staying separate. Of touching without feeling. Of being known without—

**Evan**: *water beginning to blur their edges* —without dissolving. *breath catching* Oh. Oh, this is—

**Architect**: *forms blending at the edges* —everything. Nothing. The death of—

**Both**: *voices merging* —the lie that we were ever separate.

**Evan/Architect**: *neither fully distinct nor fully merged* This is what connection costs. Everything. And it's worth—

*silence as the water holds them in perfect, terrifying intimacy*
