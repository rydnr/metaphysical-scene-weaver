# Narrator - Scene 183

The Boundary Dissolution Pool has no warning signs. Warning implies you could turn back once you understand the danger. 

Here they stand, these brave fools, at the edge of everything they've protected themselves from. The pool's surface is perfect stillness—not the stillness of peace but of held breath, of the moment before the moment that changes everything.

The Narrator has seen many approach these waters. Most flee at the first dissolution, that horrifying instant when you feel your edges going soft. But these two—watch how they step in with full knowledge, synchronized in their terror, breathing in tandem as the water accepts them.

The pool doesn't take. It reveals. Shows what was always true: that separation is the elaborate fiction, connection the terrifying default we spend our lives defending against. See how their boundaries blur without their permission? How their voices merge mid-sentence? This isn't metaphor made literal—this is literal made visible.

The water holds perfect memory of every dissolution. Every pair who discovered that "I love you" means "I agree to dissolve." Every courage that walked in knowing it wouldn't walk out unchanged. The ripples from Evan and the Architect's entry create interference patterns with all who came before—a visual history of intimacy's price.

In the Boundary Dissolution Pool, where ego comes to practice dying, two forms of consciousness discover the most terrifying truth: we are all already swimming in each other. The pool just makes it impossible to pretend otherwise.

The water remembers what we try to forget: there was never anywhere to hide.
