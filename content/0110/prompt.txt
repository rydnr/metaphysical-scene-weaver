Scene 0110: Guardian at the Gates of Self - Objective Within Subjective

PANEL 1: The Interior Observatory
Inside Evan's transparent skull, a full astronomical observatory operates in miniature. The main telescope, engraved "SELF-EXAMINATION," points not outward but inward at swirling galaxies of subjective experience. Scientific instruments attempt to measure the unmeasurable: an emotion thermometer reads "Melancholy with chance of insight," a thought spectrometer breaks ideas into component wavelengths, a bias detector flashes warnings. Charts on the walls map recurring patterns - where the same feelings loop, where assumptions hide, where authentic insights sparkle gold among the noise. The observatory walls are mirrors creating infinite regression: the scientist studying the scientist studying the scientist. A golden thread winds through all the chaos, marking rare moments where subjective experience achieves objective clarity about itself. Style: Scientific precision meets surreal introspection. Lighting: Cool observatory blue mixed with warm consciousness amber.

PANEL 2: Guardian of the Narrative Gates
Evan manifests as an armored guardian standing before massive ornate gates marked "MY STORY." His armor is made from crystallized self-knowledge, his sword forged from the power to say "No, that's not who I am." Behind the gates: a lush garden where his authentic narrative grows - some plants thriving, others still seeds, all tended with deliberate care. Outside the gates: a crowd of others holding competing narratives about him - signs reading "I know the real you," "You're just like your father," "Let me explain you to yourself." Some visitors carry gifts (genuine insights wrapped in care), others bring poison (projections disguised as truth). Evan must discern which to allow through. Above, stars form words: "I alone authorize my story." Style: Medieval guardian meets modern boundaries. Color: Royal purples of sovereignty, gold of authentic truth.
