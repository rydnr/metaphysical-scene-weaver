SCENE 0110: Guardian at the Gates of Self - Objective Within Subjective [2-panel]

DIALOGUE:
Evan: <<By understanding that, I would explore certain objectivity inside my subjectivity. Either way, I'm the guardian of what someone else can say about me.>>

VISUAL ELEMENTS:

PANEL 1 - The Interior Observatory:
- Inside Evan's transparent head, a scientific observatory studies his own thoughts
- Telescope labeled "Self-Examination" pointed inward at swirling subjective experiences
- Charts mapping patterns: where feelings repeat, where biases live, where truths crystallize
- Objective instruments measuring subjective storms: emotion thermometers, thought spectrometers
- A golden thread weaves through chaos, marking moments of genuine self-knowledge
- Mirror walls show infinite regression: the observer observing the observer observing

PANEL 2 - Guardian of the Narrative Gates:
- Evan stands as armored guardian before ornate gates labeled "My Story"
- Behind gates: a garden where his true narrative grows, tended with care
- Outside: crowds of others holding signs with their versions of him: "You're just X," "I know you better"
- His guardian sword can cut false narratives but also opens gates for truth
- Some visitors bring gifts (insights), others bring poison (projections) - he must discern
- Above: constellation spelling "Only I can authorize my authentic story"

PHILOSOPHICAL THEME: Self-Sovereignty - The Authority Over One's Own Narrative

EMOTIONAL TONE: Analytical Introspection â†’ Empowered Boundaries
