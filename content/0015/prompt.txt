Scene 0015: Uncomfortable with Scripts

Evan shifts uncomfortably, his body language rejecting invisible scripts floating around him like teleprompter text. Broken conversation templates litter the ground - "HOW'S THE WEATHER?" and "WORKING HARD OR HARDLY WORKING?" crumbling into digital dust. His hands gesture at something more real, more raw, creating ripples that disturb the prefabricated dialogue bubbles. Behind him, a wall of authentic words tries to break through social convention barriers. His expression mixes exhaustion with hope - tired of performance, craving genuine exchange. The space between him and the Architect clears of scripted nonsense, creating room for something real. Style: Social realism meets digital disruption. Colors: Authentic earth tones breaking through artificial conversation grays.
