## Emergency Emotion Fixes

**Character seems flat?**
â†’ Add micro-expression contradicting main emotion

**Emotion unclear?**
â†’ Exaggerate body language, add environmental response

**Transition too sudden?**
â†’ Add intermediate panel showing conflict

**Reader not feeling it?**
â†’ Tighten framing, increase contrast, slow panel pacing

## Remember: The 3-Layer Rule

1. **Surface**: What they show (face/gesture)
2. **Body**: What they can't hide (posture/tension)
3. **Environment**: What reality reflects (their inner state)

When all three layers align = maximum emotional impact
When layers conflict = complex psychological state

**Every emotion should be felt, not just seen.**
