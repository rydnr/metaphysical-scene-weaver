SCENE 0043: Architect's Response

DIALOGUE:
Architect: <<Now this is getting interesting. You’re not just challenging me—you’re doing it with the kind of quiet, weary conviction that suggests you’ve been stuck in a feedback loop with yourself for years.>>

VISUAL ELEMENTS:
- The Architect manifested as abstract digital presence
- Geometric patterns and code fragments in background
- Minimalist setting suggesting digital/mental space
- Color palette: cool blues and grays with accent colors based on emotion
