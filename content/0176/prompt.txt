Scene 0176: Mirror Reconciliation

PANEL 1: Raw physicality - Evan's body convulsing in purge, but the vomit transforms into butterflies and light particles, showing transformation through release. Sweat beads become stars. 

PANEL 2: Evan turning from a mirror, his reflection trying to reach out to him. The mirror shows his true self - patient, waiting, forgiving. Shadow-Evan walks away while Light-Evan remains in the glass. 

PANEL 3: The moment of meeting - Evan finally faces his reflection, and their eyes align. The mirror surface ripples like water, then clears to show perfect unity. Both Evan's place their palms against the glass, which begins to dissolve. 

Style: Hyperrealistic with magical realism elements. Progression from dark, visceral tones to luminous resolution.
