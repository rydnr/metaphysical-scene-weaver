Scene 166: The Answer's Dance

Create a 2-panel visualization of the self-knowledge paradox:

Panel 1: Figure chasing an answer that dances away with each grasp
Panel 2: Person trying impossibly to see their own eyes without a mirror

Capture the beautiful frustration of consciousness trying to know itself directly.
