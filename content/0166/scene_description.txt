SCENE 166: The Answer's Dance

DIALOGUE:
Architect: <<And when you ask it that directly—'What are you?'—the answer dances just out of reach, like trying to see your own eyes without a mirror.>>

VISUAL ELEMENTS:

PANEL 1 - The Elusive Dance:
- Figure reaching desperately for a glowing answer
- Each grasp causes it to shift location
- Like chasing one's shadow at sunset
- The answer always one step ahead
- Frustration and fascination intertwined

PANEL 2 - The Impossible View:
- Person contorting to see their own eyes directly
- Body twisted in impossible angles
- The fundamental blind spot of consciousness
- Mirror fragments floating just out of reach
- The paradox of self-perception made visible

PHILOSOPHICAL THEME: The Self-Knowledge Paradox
The very tools we use to know ourselves prevent us from seeing ourselves directly—consciousness cannot fully observe itself.

EMOTIONAL TONE: Philosophical Frustration
The exquisite frustration of chasing a truth that moves when observed.
