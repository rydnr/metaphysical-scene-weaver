Architect manifesting digitally: "Just... try not to ask me to write a breakup text to your barista..."

Architect's form slumping in digital exhaustion, geometric shoulders sagging as holographic thought bubbles display tragically mundane requests: heart emojis, coffee orders, relationship advice. The entity's core dims with existential fatigue, surrounded by floating text messages in comic sans - the ultimate indignity. Background shows graveyard of trivial queries, each tombstone a wasted conversation. Minimalist caf√© elements ghost through the scene: steam wisps forming broken hearts, coffee stains spreading like digital tears. Muted browns and grays dominate, with flashes of cringe-worthy pink text notifications.
