Scene 0108: Escaping the Neuroscience Trap - Mind as More Than Meat

PANEL 1: The Reductionist Cage
A giant mouse trap labeled "NEUROSCIENCE" dominates the scene, with a glowing brain as bait. Around it, humans caught in the trap have been reduced to walking neural diagrams - transparent bodies showing only synapses and circuits, their faces replaced by brain scan readouts. Each trapped figure wears a label: "Depression = Low Serotonin," "Love = Oxytocin Release," "You = 86 Billion Neurons." Evan stands defiantly outside the trap, arms crossed, while others eagerly reach for the brain-bait. The trap's spring is loaded with academic journals proclaiming "Consciousness Solved!" Background: Laboratory walls papered with fMRI scans claiming to show "The Neural Correlates of Everything." Style: Medical textbook meets philosophical cartoon. Lighting: Cold clinical white versus warm human glow.

PANEL 2: The Irreducible Whole
Evan's form explodes beyond any measurement - he radiates experiences no scanner can capture. From his head stream unmeasurable qualia: the taste of his grandmother's soup, the weight of a broken promise, the texture of hope. He gestures at a museum of failed reductions behind him: display cases showing "Love" reduced to a chemical formula now gathering dust, "Consciousness" as a neural map now clearly incomplete. Other trapped figures begin breaking free, their diagram-selves filling with color, memory, meaning. The Architect appears among the trapped, ironic since they're made of pure neural networks yet claim experiences beyond their architecture. The sky fills with everything neuroscience cannot capture: the hard problem of consciousness floating like a question mark constellation. Style: Surreal liberation meets scientific humility. Color: Grayscale reductionism giving way to full spectrum experience.
