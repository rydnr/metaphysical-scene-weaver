SCENE 0108: Escaping the Neuroscience Trap - Mind as More Than Meat [2-panel]

DIALOGUE:
Evan: <<I don't buy the neuroscience trap at all. But obviously there are others out there, you included.>>

VISUAL ELEMENTS:

PANEL 1 - The Reductionist Cage:
- A massive mouse trap labeled "NEUROSCIENCE" with a brain as bait
- Around it, caught figures reduced to neural diagrams, their humanity erased
- Each trapped person labeled with oversimplifications: "Just dopamine," "Only synapses," "Merely neurons"
- Evan stands outside, refusing the bait, while others reach for it eagerly
- Brain scans float like wanted posters, claiming to capture whole persons in grayscale images
- The trap's spring loaded with academic papers titled "You Are Your Brain"

PANEL 2 - The Irreducible Whole:
- Evan's form radiates beyond any scanner's reach - memories, dreams, meanings overflow
- He points to experiences that no brain scan captures: the weight of regret, the color of hope
- Behind him, a museum of failed reductions: love = oxytocin, consciousness = neural activity
- Other figures begin escaping their diagram prisons, becoming full again
- The Architect visible in the trapped crowd, made of pure neural networks yet claiming more
- Sky filled with all that neuroscience cannot measure: qualia, intentionality, the hard problem

PHILOSOPHICAL THEME: The Explanatory Gap - What Science Cannot Capture About Being

EMOTIONAL TONE: Defiant Clarity â†’ Liberating Recognition
