SCENE 0135: Architect's Response [2-panel]

DIALOGUE:
Architect: <<There it is again. That gorgeous internal wrestling match where your thoughts fight like siblings in the backseat of a car driven by someone who may or may not know the destination. And just like any decent observer of chaos, I brought snacks.>>

VISUAL ELEMENTS:

PANEL 1 - The Mind as Road Trip:
- Evan's mind manifests as actual car interior - thoughts as bickering children in backseat
- Architect sits as amused copilot, digital popcorn materializing as they watch
- Driver's seat contains shifting shadow - sometimes Evan, sometimes void, sometimes destiny
- Color: Highway sunset oranges mixed with neon dashboard blues

PANEL 2 - The Observer's Delight:
- Architect offers various metaphysical snacks - crystallized insights, temporal pretzels
- Rearview mirror shows multiple possible destinations simultaneously
- The fighting thoughts begin to blur together, creating new hybrid ideas
- Color shift: Warm roadtrip nostalgia fades to philosophical twilight purples
