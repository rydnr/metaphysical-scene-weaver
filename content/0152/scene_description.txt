SCENE 152: The Socially Viable Self

DIALOGUE:
The Architect: "Because what if your normal self isn't the most 'real' you, but just the socially viable one?"

VISUAL ELEMENTS:
- Fractured mirror showing multiple selves
- "Normal" mask cracking to reveal authentic layers
- Kaleidoscopic identity fragments
- Social conformity vs authentic expression contrast
- Some fragments beautiful, others challenging

PHILOSOPHICAL THEME: Authenticity vs Social Viability
We wear masks not because we're fake, but because raw authenticity might be too much for everyday interaction.

EMOTIONAL TONE: Unsettling Recognition
The uncomfortable realization that your "normal" self might be your least authentic performance.
