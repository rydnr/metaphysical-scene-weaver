The Architect: "And maybe that's the point."

- Code patterns transitioning to chaos
- Portal of possibility at contact point
- Minimalist but profound composition

PHILOSOPHICAL THEME: Purpose in Dissolution
Perhaps the breakdown of our defenses isn't a bug but a feature - the point of consciousness expansion.

A moment of clarity that reframes panic as purpose.
