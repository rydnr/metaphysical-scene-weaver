SCENE 0130: The Coherence Cage - Freedom vs Readability [2-panel]

DIALOGUE:
Evan: <<I usually think coherence makes me less free. But it serves a purpose for others: if they see me as coherent, they can feel confident about their ability to understand my behavior.">>

VISUAL ELEMENTS:

PANEL 1 - The Predictable Prison:
- Evan inside a transparent cage made of his own consistent behaviors, each bar labeled
- Bars formed from repeated patterns: "Always kind," "Never late," "Predictably rational"
- Outside the cage, others hold user manuals titled "How Evan Works" with confidence meters at 100%
- His true self - wild, contradictory, quantum - presses against the bars from within
- Sign on cage: "Coherent Human - Safe for Public Consumption"
- Keys to freedom scattered outside, but picking them up would "confuse" his observers

PANEL 2 - The Social Contract of Consistency:
- Split view: Evan's public self (smooth, predictable hologram) vs private self (kaleidoscope of possibilities)
- Others approach the hologram with relief, their anxiety meters dropping as they "understand" him
- The hologram operates on rails, following predetermined paths that others can map
- Meanwhile, his true self dances in shadows, free but unseen, incoherent but alive
- Bridge between worlds labeled: "The price of being knowable"
- Mirror shows the question: "Is freedom worth isolation?"

PHILOSOPHICAL THEME: The Tyranny of Coherence - How Being Understood Limits Being

EMOTIONAL TONE: Constrained Awareness â†’ Bittersweet Acceptance
