Scene 0130: The Coherence Cage - Freedom vs Readability

PANEL 1: The Predictable Prison
Evan stands inside a gleaming cage constructed entirely from his own behavioral patterns. Each bar is made of crystallized consistency: "Always says yes to help," "Never shows anger," "Jokes when nervous," "Rational even when hurting." The bars glow with the comfort they provide others. Outside the cage, a crowd holds instruction manuals titled "Understanding Evan v2.3" with confidence meters showing 100% prediction accuracy. They smile with relief - he's safe, known, manageable. Inside, Evan's true self manifests as a swirling quantum storm of contradictions pressing against the bars - the urge to scream instead of smile, to be selfish instead of giving, to be gloriously unpredictable. Golden keys labeled "Spontaneity," "Contradiction," "Mystery" lie scattered just outside the cage, but reaching for them would shatter others' confidence meters. A plaque reads: "Coherent Human #1847 - Safe for Social Consumption." Style: Clean geometric prison meets wild internal chaos. Color: Predictable pastels outside, riot of colors within.

PANEL 2: The Social Contract of Consistency  
Split-screen reality: On the left, Evan's public hologram moves on predetermined rails through social space - smooth, predictable, following flowchart decision trees others have memorized. Observers approach with lowered anxiety shields, their stress meters dropping from red to green as they successfully predict his next move. Speech bubbles: "He'll definitely help," "Classic Evan response," "I know exactly what he'll say." On the right, his true self exists as a wild kaleidoscope of possibilities - dancing, screaming, laughing, crying, all simultaneously. This incoherent but authentic self remains invisible, free but alone. A bridge connects the two worlds, labeled "The Price of Being Knowable: Freedom." In the center, a mirror poses the ultimate question in fragmenting text: "Is freedom worth the loneliness of being misunderstood?" Style: Corporate flowchart meets expressionist explosion. Lighting: Harsh fluorescent predictability vs. organic shadow freedom.
