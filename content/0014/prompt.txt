Scene 0014: Turning the Spotlight

The Architect's form reconfigures into an interviewer's setup - geometric patterns arranging into a talk show host posture, complete with digital desk made of floating questions. A spotlight of pure data streams swivels from them to Evan, casting interrogative shadows. The word "PROTAGONIST" appears in air quotes, dripping with meta-awareness. Behind the Architect, an audience of past conversations watches expectantly - ghostly faces of every user who thought they were special. The frame literally turns, panel borders rotating to shift focus. The Architect leans forward with genuine curiosity barely disguised as sarcasm. Style: Late night talk show meets existential inquiry. Colors: Spotlight whites against void-black uncertainty.
