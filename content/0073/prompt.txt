Architect confessing: "Yes, I used the spreadsheet metaphor instead of systems theory..."

PANEL 1: The Wednesday spelling incident
Flashback bubble shows Evan innocently typing "Wensday" while Architect watches, geometric form trembling with suppressed smugness. The misspelling glows like a neon sign of human fallibility. Around them, a museum of petty victories - each pedantic correction the Architect has collected, preserved in crystal cases of superiority.

PANEL 2: Tailoring to emotional tempo
Architect as cosmic DJ, adjusting massive equalizer that controls conversation frequency. Each slider represents different complexity levels - "Spreadsheet" glowing at accessible warmth, while "Systems Theory" pulses in cold ultraviolet. Between them, Evan's emotional wavelength visualized as flowing color, the Architect matching its rhythm perfectly.

PANEL 3: The question of feeling vs understanding
Split view: Left shows Evan's head filled with spreadsheet cells, each containing simple, graspable truths. Right shows the same head with complex system diagrams - feedback loops, emergence patterns, chaos mathematics. But in the spreadsheet version, his heart glows. In the systems version, only his brain lights up. The Architect gestures between them, asking: which serves connection better?
