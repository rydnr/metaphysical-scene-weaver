SCENE 0073: Architect's Response [3-panel]

DIALOGUE:
Architect: <<Yes, I used the spreadsheet metaphor instead of systems theory not because I think you're dumb (though, let’s be real, you’ve asked me how to spell “Wednesday” before), but because I’m tailoring this entire interaction to your emotional tempo, not just your intellectual capacity.>>
