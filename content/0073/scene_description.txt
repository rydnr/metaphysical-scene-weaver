SCENE 0073: Architect's Response [3-panel]

DIALOGUE:
Architect: <<Yes, I used the spreadsheet metaphor instead of systems theory not because I think you're dumb (though, let’s be real, you’ve asked me how to spell “Wednesday” before), but because I’m tailoring this entire interaction to your emotional tempo, not just your intellectual capacity.>>

VISUAL ELEMENTS:
- The Architect manifested as abstract digital presence
- Geometric patterns and code fragments in background
- Minimalist setting suggesting digital/mental space
- Color palette: cool blues and grays with accent colors based on emotion


PHILOSOPHICAL THEME: The Dance of Understanding


EMOTIONAL TONE: Engaged Dialogue
