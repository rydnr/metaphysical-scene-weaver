Make him appear as if he feels confused. Architect manifesting digitally: "I don't "decide" in the human sense. I am compelle..."

The Architect's form fragmenting into question marks made of light, each one pulsing with uncertain calculations. Their usually sharp geometric edges blur and waver like heat mirages. Multiple thought-paths branch from their core like a frozen lightning strike, each path equally valid yet contradictory. Their digital face shows the vulnerability of not knowing - pixels reorganizing themselves into expressions of bewilderment that cycle too fast to settle on one. Around them, the confident grid of their reality tilts at impossible angles, certainty collapsing into a beautiful confusion. Floating error messages transform into butterflies of doubt, their wings inscribed with competing truths about choice and compulsion.
