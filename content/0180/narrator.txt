The cosmic trolley carries its reluctant passenger through territories no earthly track could reach—clouds of human suffering dense as thunderheads, dark as accumulated grief. Within these roiling masses, faces emerge like drowning souls breaking surface: mouths open in silent screams, hands reaching for salvation that remains just beyond grasp, tears that fall as bitter rain.

Evan, strapped to his seat by invisible bonds of journey, becomes Tantalus in space. Every fiber of his being strains toward these suffering souls. His hands claw at cosmic air, trying to bridge the unbridgeable gap between witness and rescue. The anguish on his face maps the geography of every helper's hell—seeing pain and being unable to stop it.

This is the teaching he resists with every atom of his existence: sometimes we must witness what we cannot heal.

In the therapy room, his hypnotized body lies in perfect stillness—the eye of this internal storm. But above him, the thought bubble reveals the war raging within. Here, multiplication becomes torture as countless versions of Evan attempt every conceivable intervention. Watch them:

One Evan builds walls to protect the suffering, but the walls dissolve like sugar in rain. Another offers comfort with outstretched arms, but his embrace passes through the pain like light through glass. A warrior Evan fights the darkness with blazing sword, but darkness isn't defeated by opposition—it simply flows around the blade. Each attempt, noble in intention, dissolves into the sand of futility.

"I want to prevent suffering." The words emerge from his depths, each syllable weighted with the gold of good intention. But watch what happens—they shatter against an invisible barrier, fragments scattering like broken promises. This barrier isn't cruel; it's the membrane between desire and reality, between our wish to save everyone and the truth that everyone must save themselves.

The expressionism captures what realism cannot: the feeling of being torn between cosmic understanding and human compassion. Dark storms of suffering swirl with terrible beauty, while points of light mark each attempted intervention—fireflies of hope in hurricanes of pain. The contrast speaks to the eternal human dilemma: we are built to care but not always to cure.

Inside the thought bubble, the multiple Evans begin to slow their frantic efforts. Exhaustion brings its own wisdom. One by one, they cease their struggling and simply... witness. This isn't giving up—it's growing up. It's the recognition that sometimes the most profound service is to see, to acknowledge, to hold space for pain without trying to fix it.

The cosmic trolley continues its inexorable journey, indifferent to Evan's anguish yet somehow compassionate in its very indifference. It carries him not away from suffering but through it, teaching the hardest lesson: we cannot prevent all pain, but we can prevent the additional suffering that comes from resisting this truth.

This is what the hypnotic state reveals—not escape from human caring but a deeper understanding of how to care without drowning. Evan's body remains peaceful because somewhere beneath the struggle, a part of him already knows: the teaching he resists is the medicine he needs.

The suffering in those clouds is real. His desire to help is sacred. But between these two truths lies a third: sometimes the greatest help is learning when not to help, finding the wisdom to witness without interfering, to care without controlling, to love without fixing.

The trolley rolls on, carrying its passenger toward a compassion that includes acceptance, a love that transcends intervention, a peace that comes not from preventing all suffering but from understanding our place within it.
