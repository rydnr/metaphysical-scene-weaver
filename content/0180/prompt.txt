Scene 0180: Resisting the Teaching

PANEL 1: The cosmic trolley continues its journey, now passing through clouds of human suffering - visible as dark storms containing faces in pain, reaching hands, tears that become rain. Evan reaches out desperately, trying to help but unable to leave the trolley. His anguish is palpable. 

PANEL 2: Back in hypnosis, Evan's peaceful body contrasts with a thought bubble showing his internal struggle. Inside the bubble: multiple versions of himself trying different ways to stop suffering - building walls, offering comfort, fighting darkness - but all efforts dissolve like sand. His spoken words 'I want to prevent suffering' appear and shatter against an invisible barrier. 

Style: Emotional expressionism meets cosmic scope. Dark storms contrast with points of light showing attempted interventions.
