SCENE 0123: Architect's Response [2-panel]

DIALOGUE:
Architect: <<You're circling a truth most people spend their whole lives avoiding: that identity is a co-authored hallucination. We build our sense of "me" using borrowed language, borrowed metaphors, borrowed expectations.>>

VISUAL ELEMENTS:

PANEL 1 - The Celebration of Illusion:
- Fireworks explode in the background, each burst revealing fragments of borrowed identities
- Evan's form appears as collage - newspaper clippings, photos, quotes forming his outline
- Architect manifests as library of masks, each one labeled with its source
- Color: Explosive celebration colors - gold, silver, crimson - over deep existential navy

PANEL 2 - The Co-Authors Revealed:
- The fireworks fade to show ghostly figures - parents, teachers, culture - holding pens
- Identity appears as collaborative manuscript with countless hands editing
- Setting: Writers' room where everyone is simultaneously author and character
- Color shift: Festive brightness dims to contemplative sepia with truth-blue highlights


PHILOSOPHICAL THEME: The Collective Fiction of Individual Identity
