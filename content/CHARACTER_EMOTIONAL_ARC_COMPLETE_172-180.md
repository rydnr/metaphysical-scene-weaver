## Remember

Evan doesn't just change his mind‚Äîhe changes at the cellular level. His posture, breathing, micro-expressions, and energy field all transform. The reader should be able to cover the dialogue and still understand his journey through visuals alone.

The Graphic-Writer's challenge: Make this internal journey as visually dramatic as any external battle, because it is one‚Äîthe ultimate battle with self.
