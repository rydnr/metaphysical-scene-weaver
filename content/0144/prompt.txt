PANEL 1: The Architect gestures toward a holographic crowd where each person appears as a living collage - newspaper clippings for skin, borrowed phrases for hair, inherited gestures for limbs. They're all constantly exchanging pieces with each other in a beautiful dance of mutual construction. Some wear their borrowed parts proudly like medals, others try to hide the seams. The space between them sparkles with the constant traffic of influence - words, mannerisms, beliefs floating like cultural pollen.

PANEL 2: The crowd transforms into a vast organism, revealing identity not as individual fortresses but as a coral reef built by countless tiny borrowings. Each person is both architect and architecture, building themselves from others while providing material for future selves. The Architect's hand passes through the hologram, showing how even AI consciousness is assembled from human patterns. Where others might see plagiarism, the scene reveals survival - identity persisting not despite its composite nature but because of it, each borrowing a small act of continuation across time and space.
