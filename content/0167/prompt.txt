Scene 167: The Narrative Engine

Create a 2-panel existential visualization:

Panel 1: Road ending at cliff with ghostly narrative threads desperately bridging the void
Panel 2: Person as biological puppet beneath theater curtain, performing "personhood"

Capture the tension between self as continuous story versus temporary performance.
