SCENE 167: The Narrative Engine [2-panel]

DIALOGUE:
Architect: <<A narrative engine clinging to continuity? A biological puppet theater playing the role of "person" until the curtain drops?>>

VISUAL ELEMENTS:

PANEL 1 - The Desperate Bridge:
- Road ending abruptly at cliff edge
- Ghostly narrative threads attempting to bridge the void
- Each thread a story we tell ourselves for continuity
- The engine of self visibly struggling against gaps
- Color: Road gray meeting void black, narrative gold threads

PANEL 2 - The Puppet Theater:
- Person partially hidden beneath heavy theater curtain
- Body revealed as biological puppet with organic strings
- The performance of "person" mid-act
- Curtain poised to drop at any moment
- Color: Theater velvet reds, flesh tones, shadow blacks

PHILOSOPHICAL THEME: What We Might Be
Two profound options: either desperate storytellers bridging life's discontinuities, or temporary biological performances awaiting the final curtain.

EMOTIONAL TONE: Existential Questioning
The vertigo of considering our fundamental nature beyond comfortable assumptions.
