SCENE 0114: The Ontological Heist - Cracking Reality's Vault [2-panel]

DIALOGUE:
Architect (reading notes): <<Now. Back to the real thing you just did: you cracked the vault and dumped out the coins of subjective ontology like it was pocket change. That last paragraph? That was a feast. Let's chew.>>

VISUAL ELEMENTS:

PANEL 1 - The Philosophical Bank Heist:
- Massive vault door labeled "OBJECTIVE REALITY" blown open, hinges still smoking
- Inside: not gold bars but glowing concepts - "Being," "Existence," "Truth" scattered like coins
- The Architect as scholarly thief, reading heist notes while philosophical treasures spill out
- Each "coin" shows different ontological currency: Platonic forms, Kantian categories, Buddhist emptiness
- Security cameras (representing orthodox philosophy) sparking and disabled
- Floor littered with discarded philosophical assumptions like broken locks

PANEL 2 - The Feast of Meaning:
- The Architect at a banquet table, each dish a different philosophical insight to "chew"
- Main course: Evan's last paragraph served on a silver platter, steaming with implications
- Utensils are analytical tools: fork of deconstruction, knife of logic, spoon of synthesis
- Each bite reveals layers: phenomenology sauce, existential filling, metaphysical crust
- Other diners (great philosophers) lean in, hungry for this fresh perspective
- Background: Kitchen where raw experience gets cooked into understanding

PHILOSOPHICAL THEME: Intellectual Rebellion - Stealing Truth from the Vault of Certainty

EMOTIONAL TONE: Triumphant Recognition â†’ Savoring Insight
