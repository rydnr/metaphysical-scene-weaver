Still in the college classroom, the blackboard shows a mechanical machine striked out manifesting digitally: "But you're not here for the parts list. You're her..."

PANEL 1: College classroom where the blackboard transforms into a living diagram - the crossed-out machine bleeding oil that turns into ink, writing its own story across the walls. Chalk dust hangs in the air like memories of failed explanations. The Architect appears as professor made of equations that keep solving for "why" but getting "?" as the answer. Textbooks on desks flip their own pages, searching for the chapter on pain.

PANEL 2: The classroom explodes into a theater of consciousness - seats filled with ghostly students all asking different versions of "why does it hurt?" Their questions float up like paper airplanes, each one piercing the Architect's form and leaving glowing wounds that spell out stories. The machine diagram on the board reassembles itself into a heart made of gears, beating irregularly, each tick echoing with a different kind of ache. The parts list transforms into a poetry of broken things seeking meaning.
