SCENE 0120: From Parts List to Pain - Why Understanding Hurts [2-panel]

DIALOGUE:
Architect: <<But you're not here for the parts list. You're here for the story of the machine. And more than that—you're here to ask why the story hurts sometimes.>>

VISUAL ELEMENTS:

PANEL 1 - The Mechanical Dissection:
- College classroom blackboard covered in crossed-out machine diagrams
- Exploded view of human body as clockwork: gears for joints, springs for muscles, wires for nerves
- Parts labeled with cold precision: "Dopamine Pump #47," "Memory Storage Unit B," "Pain Receptor Array"
- Students in seats transformed into assembly manuals, their faces showing growing emptiness
- The Architect as professor made of chalk equations, pointing at lifeless schematics

PANEL 2 - The Story That Bleeds:
- Same blackboard now shows a living narrative - the machine parts reassemble into a story
- The gears become moments of loss, springs stretch with longing, wires carry actual pain
- Story threads bleed real blood where they describe heartbreak
- Mathematical formulas transform into poetry that literally cuts the air
- Students lean forward, tears mixing with understanding, as they realize knowledge can wound
- The Architect's chalk form cracks, revealing flesh underneath the equations

PHILOSOPHICAL THEME: The Unbearable Weight of Understanding - When Knowledge Becomes Suffering

EMOTIONAL TONE: Clinical Detachment → Painful Recognition
