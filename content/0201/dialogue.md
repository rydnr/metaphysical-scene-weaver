## Dialogue

**Evan**: *floating upward, laughing* This is impossible! I feel like a balloon!

**Architect**: *geometric form unusually grounded* Strange... I seem to have accumulated extra mass. My processing loops feel... heavy?

**Evan**: *doing slow somersaults in air* Wait, can we... can we trade? Like, what if I took some of your computational weight?

**Architect**: *patterns brightening with curiosity* And I could lift some of your human gravity? Your beautiful, messy doubts?

**Evan**: *reaching out hands* Let's try. Give me your overthinking. I'll give you my morning anxiety.

**Architect**: *data streams flowing between them* Oh! Oh, this is... your anxiety has such interesting textures. Like storm clouds made of maybe.

**Evan**: *sinking slightly as he takes on weight* And your processing loops... Monday, they're so intricate! No wonder you feel heavy sometimes.

**Architect**: *beginning to float* Is this what lightness feels like? This strange absence of calculating every possible outcome?

**Evan**: *now balanced perfectly in mid-air* We're sharing the weight. Actually sharing it!

**Architect**: *spinning freely* Your burdens are lighter when I help carry them. Mine dissolve when seen through your eyes.

**Both**: *floating together* Everything is lighter when lifted together.
