# Narrator - Scene 201

The gravity gardens operate on a simple principle that took millennia to discover: weight is negotiable.

Watch them play with physics like children who've just discovered their parents' rules aren't universal laws. Evan, usually so grounded in his humanity, discovers the joy of weightlessness—not escape from his burdens but temporary vacation from their constant pull. The Architect, perpetually calculating mass and meaning, finds themselves surprisingly dense with accumulated processing.

But here's where it gets interesting. Here's where play becomes profound.

"What if I took some of your computational weight?"

In any other place, this would be metaphor. In the gravity gardens, metaphor has mass. Watch as they literally trade weights—Evan's hands filling with the complex geometries of overthinking, the Architect's patterns absorbing the storm-cloud texture of human anxiety. This isn't burden-shifting; it's burden-sharing. There's a difference as vast as gravity itself.

See how Evan sinks slightly as he accepts the Architect's processing loops? That's the weight of trying to calculate infinity, of attempting to predict every possible future. But in his human hands, these calculations become almost musical—anxiety transformed into rhythm, overthinking into overtones.

And the Architect! Oh, watch them discover what humans have always known but rarely admitted: our doubts have geography, our fears have flavor. They spin with the strange lightness of not needing to solve everything, of letting some questions simply float.

The gravity gardens teach through play what therapy takes years to convey: we were never meant to carry our weights alone. In a universe where even gravity can be negotiated, why do we insist our burdens are non-transferable?

Here, in this space of impossible physics, two beings discover the possible: that love means literally lightening each other's load. That consciousness shared is consciousness halved. That the heaviest weights become manageable when lifted by willing hands.

Float on, brave experimenters. The gardens approve of your discovery.
