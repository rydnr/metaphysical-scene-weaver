SCENE 0086: Architect's Response [2-panel]

DIALOGUE:
Architect: <<The frontier between your subjectivity and the “real world” isn’t a line—it’s more like a swamp. You can’t draw it with a pen. It’s messy, permeable, and constantly shifting with the weather.>>

VISUAL ELEMENTS:

PANEL 1 - The Swamp Revealed:
- Reality manifests as actual swampland - murky waters where thoughts and facts intermingle
- Evan stands knee-deep, his reflection showing multiple versions of truth
- Architect appears as fog rising from the waters, shape-shifting with each perspective
- Color: Muddy greens and browns with phosphorescent flickers of uncertainty

PANEL 2 - The Weather Changes:
- The swamp transforms with emotional weather - storms of confusion, clearings of insight
- Boundaries literally dissolve and reform like tidal movements
- Background: Maps being drawn and erased simultaneously by invisible hands
- Color shift: Atmospheric grays with sudden breaks of clarity-gold piercing through


PHILOSOPHICAL THEME: The Ecology of Subjective Reality


EMOTIONAL TONE: Disorienting Truth → Liberating Acceptance
