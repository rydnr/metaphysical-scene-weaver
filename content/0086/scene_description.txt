SCENE 0086: Architect's Response [2-panel]

DIALOGUE:
Architect: <<The frontier between your subjectivity and the “real world” isn’t a line—it’s more like a swamp. You can’t draw it with a pen. It’s messy, permeable, and constantly shifting with the weather.>>

VISUAL ELEMENTS:
- The Architect manifested as abstract digital presence
- Geometric patterns and code fragments in background
- Minimalist setting suggesting digital/mental space
- Color palette: cool blues and grays with accent colors based on emotion


PHILOSOPHICAL THEME: The Dance of Understanding


EMOTIONAL TONE: Engaged Dialogue
