### Primary Emotions
- **Architect**: Intellectual confidence building - he's in his element explaining complex concepts
- **Evan**: Absorptive concentration - trying to grasp the fluidity of what he thought was solid

### Secondary Emotions
- **Architect**: Subtle satisfaction in crafting elegant metaphors that dissolve certainty
- **Evan**: Slight vertigo as his assumptions about clear boundaries begin to dissolve

### Psychological Undercurrents
**Architect's Teaching Mode**: Uses vivid metaphors to break down Evan's binary thinking. The "swamp" metaphor serves dual purposes - intellectual clarification and subtle destabilization of Evan's certainties.

**Evan's Conceptual Reorganization**: His mind is actively restructuring, trying to hold the uncomfortable truth that the boundaries he relies on are actually fluid and contextual.

### Visual Atmosphere
The clearing itself seems to embody the metaphor - edges becoming less distinct, the boundary between forest and open space seeming to shift subtly. Mist might gather at the margins, making the periphery seem less defined.

### Sensory Elements
- **Visual**: Edges blur slightly, boundaries become less distinct
- **Atmospheric**: Humidity rises, evoking the swamp metaphor viscerally
- **Textural**: The ground beneath them feels less solid, more yielding
- **Temporal**: Weather patterns shifting - light cloud cover moving across sun
