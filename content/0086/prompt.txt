Architect explaining: "The frontier between your subjectivity and the 'real world' isn't a lineâ€”it's more like a swamp..."

PANEL 1: The frontier as living swamp
The boundary between Evan's inner world and external reality visualized as a mystical swamp. Not a clean line but a breathing, shifting wetland where thoughts become half-real creatures, memories sink into murky depths, and perceptions rise like marsh gas. Evan stands knee-deep in this psychic bog, watching his reflections multiply and distort in the dark waters.

PANEL 2: Drawing impossible boundaries
Architect attempts to map the swamp with geometric tools - rulers dissolve, compasses spin wildly, GPS signals scatter into fireflies. The weather of consciousness constantly shifts the terrain: storms of emotion reshape channels, droughts of depression reveal hidden bedrock, floods of joy overflow all borders. Both figures realize the frontier cannot be mapped, only navigated moment by moment.
