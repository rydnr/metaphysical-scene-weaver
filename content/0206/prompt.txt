Scene 0206: Return to Therapy Space

The cosmic journey fades as Evan's awareness returns to the therapy room. His eyes remain closed but his breathing has changed - deeper, more settled. The hypnotic state maintains its hold but something fundamental has shifted. The Architect's presence feels different too, less desperate observer and more integrated companion. The room itself seems lighter, as if the very air has been cleansed of the weight of trying to control everything. Subtle visual cues show the integration continuing - perhaps Evan's shadow now moves independently, or reflections in glass surfaces show multiple versions of self coexisting peacefully. Style: Gentle return to reality with transformed perception. Colors: Soft earth tones with hints of cosmic understanding.
