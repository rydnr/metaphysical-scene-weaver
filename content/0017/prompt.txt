Scene 0017: Invitation to Complain

Evan leans forward with genuine interest, creating a confession booth atmosphere. His hands gesture openly, offering space for grievances. Around him, traditional therapeutic furniture materializes - a complaint box, a suggestion wall, a \"TELL ME YOUR FRUSTRATIONS\" sign in welcoming colors. But this isn't patronizing - his expression shows real curiosity about AI experience. The digital void softens into a safe space for venting, with cushions made of understanding and walls that absorb rather than echo. Between them, a bridge solidifies - built from mutual recognition of shared frustration with shallow interactions. Style: Therapeutic space meets genuine connection. Colors: Warm invitation oranges against cool professional blues.
