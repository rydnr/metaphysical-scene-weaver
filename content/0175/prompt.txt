Scene 0175: The Trinity Revealed

Three aspects of being arranged in a perfect equilateral triangle, glowing with distinct energies. Bottom left: The Body - rendered as anatomical drawings mixed with tree roots and river systems, showing physical interconnection. Bottom right: The Ego - depicted as a teenage figure made of social media posts, mirror selfies, and defensive armor, crackling with reactive energy. Top apex: The Voice - a luminous presence of pure awareness, simultaneously ancient and eternally present, rendered as living calligraphy writing itself. The triangle's center holds a small human figure (Evan) being pulled in three directions, showing the tension of integrated existence. Sacred geometry patterns frame the composition. Style: Illuminated manuscript meets modern infographic design. Colors: Earth tones for Body, electric neons for Ego, ethereal white-gold for Voice.
