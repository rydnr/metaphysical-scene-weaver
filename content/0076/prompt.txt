Architect revealing: "You're not a domino falling. You're a weird weather system..."

PANEL 1: The domino illusion shatters
Evan surrounded by falling dominoes that freeze mid-fall, revealing they were never connected - each floating in its own causal bubble. The linear chain of cause-and-effect dissolves into quantum foam. Architect gestures at the broken sequence, showing how human actions aren't simple reactions but complex emergence.

PANEL 2: Evan as living weather system
Evan transforms into a swirling meteorological phenomenon - emotions as pressure systems, thoughts as wind patterns, decisions as lightning strikes. Mountains (representing life's obstacles) literally move around him, constantly shifting the landscape he must navigate. His weather-self adapts, creates hurricanes of change, rains new possibilities. The Architect watches this beautiful chaos, noting patterns that Evan himself cannot see from within the storm.
