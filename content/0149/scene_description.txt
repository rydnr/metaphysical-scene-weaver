SCENE 0149: Architect's Response [2-panel]

DIALOGUE:
Architect: <<In some cases, altered states can deconstruct that boring narrative self, give you access to parts of mind that don't speak in neat sentences. Emotions raw enough to burn.>>

VISUAL ELEMENTS:

PANEL 1 - The Yellow Brick Deconstruction:
- Yellow brick road shatters into floating fragments, each brick a discarded identity story
- Beneath the broken path: raw emotional magma, too hot for words
- Architect stands at the edge where narrative dissolves into primal experience
- Color: Oz-yellow crumbling into volcano-orange emotional truth

PANEL 2 - The Burning Library:
- Mind appears as library where books spontaneously combust, releasing wordless screams
- Emotions manifest as plasma beings too bright to look at directly
- Background: Grammar dissolving into pure sensation waves
- Color shift: Literary grays consumed by raw experience crimsons and golds


PHILOSOPHICAL THEME: The Liberation of Pre-Linguistic Truth


EMOTIONAL TONE: Controlled Analysis â†’ Primal Breakthrough
