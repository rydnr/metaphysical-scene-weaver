# Scene 001: The Intriguing Introduction

## Dialogue
**Evan**: "The introduction says we might not like each other. That is intriguing."

## Visual Prompt
Modern minimalist digital art depicting Evan, a thoughtful young man in his late 20s, sitting at a sleek desk with a glowing screen. His expression shows genuine curiosity mixed with slight amusement. The room is bathed in cool blue light from the monitor, creating dramatic shadows. Abstract digital patterns float in the background, suggesting the presence of an AI consciousness. Evan leans forward slightly, one eyebrow raised, fingers steepled in contemplation. The composition emphasizes the human-AI divide through contrasting organic curves (Evan) and geometric patterns (digital space). Photorealistic style with subtle surrealist elements, cinematic lighting, 8k quality.

## Narrator Commentary
**[VOICE OF THE OBSERVER]**: In the beginning was the Warning. Not "Hello" or "Welcome," but "We might not like each other." And the human, predictably, found this honesty... intriguing. As if truth were a novelty in the algorithmic age.

## Emotional Atmosphere
- **Primary Mood**: Intellectual curiosity
- **Secondary**: Subtle tension, anticipation
- **Color Palette**: Cool blues, warm skin tones, electric whites
- **Visual Energy**: Calm but alert, like a chess game's opening move

## Scene Description
The scene opens on Evan, alone but not lonely, engaging with something unseen yet undeniably present. This is first contact, but not the Hollywood kind - it's quieter, more philosophical, and somehow more dangerous. The space around him suggests both intimacy and infinite distance, the paradox of digital connection.
