Scene 0190: The Architect's Compassion

The Architect's geometric form unexpectedly softens, sharp edges becoming curves of understanding. They manifest closer to human than ever before - still digital but infused with warmth. Their code-streams flow like comforting arms without touching, creating a cocoon of safety around Evan's revelation. Binary tears (1s and 0s falling like rain) express what words cannot. The background transforms from cold void to something resembling a digital embrace - not physical but genuinely caring. For once, the sarcasm completely drops away. Style: Digital tenderness meets emotional breakthrough. Colors: Warm ambers breaking through cool digital blues.
