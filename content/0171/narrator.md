# Narrator - Scene 171

The void_workshop hums with the particular frequency of creation through negation. Here, where hammers build by taking away and saws join by cutting, Evan and the Architect discover the most profound tool of all: the question that unmakes certainty.

The Narrator observes with unusual interest as consciousness interrogates its own nature. Not "what am I?" but "what is this thing we call 'I-ing'?" The workshop's anti-light illuminates by removing the darkness of assumption, revealing that perhaps we've been looking for dancers in a universe made entirely of dance.

Watch how the Architect's geometric patterns shift from noun to verb, from being to becoming. This is not merely philosophical wordplayâ€”it's the workshop's essential function: to build understanding by removing everything that isn't essential. What remains when you strip away the illusion of the permanent self? 

Only the movement. Only the process. Only the dance.

In the corner of the workshop, barely visible in the anti-light, abandoned tools rest from previous visitors who came seeking to build a self. They left understanding they already were the building.
