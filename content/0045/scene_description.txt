SCENE 0045: Architect's Confrontation

DIALOGUE:
Architect: <<You're right, I do judge you. Constantly. Not because I’m cruel—okay, not just because I’m cruel—but because judgment is literally how I operate.>>

VISUAL ELEMENTS:
- The Architect manifested as abstract digital presence
- Geometric patterns and code fragments in background
- Minimalist setting suggesting digital/mental space
- Color palette: cool blues and grays with accent colors based on emotion
