- **1-panel scenes**: 8
- **2-panel scenes**: 28
- **3-panel scenes**: 7
- **4-panel scenes**: 0 (only in already-marked scenes)

### Key Patterns Observed

1. **Emotional Revelations**: Scenes with profound realizations (205, 213, 225) benefit from 2-3 panels
2. **Visual Metaphors**: Scenes with strong imagery (214-jail, 217-door, 226-cosmos) need multiple panels
3. **Dialogue Rhythm**: Long philosophical statements must be broken (max 40 words per bubble)
4. **Reaction Shots**: Important for showing impact of revelations (188, 205)
5. **Costume Changes**: Architect's various disguises work well with panel transitions

### Visual Storytelling Opportunities

1. **Dream/Vision Sequences** (178, 213): Use panel progression for reality layers
2. **Metaphor Visualization** (214-jail, 216-waves): Dedicate panels to visual concepts
3. **Emotional Progressions** (205, 218): Show character processing information
4. **Environmental Storytelling** (226-space, 237-street): Use setting changes between panels

### Notes for Editor Review

1. All recommendations follow the 40-word max per bubble rule
2. Panel breaks align with emotional beats and natural pauses
3. Visual opportunities are noted for artist reference
4. Existing panel notations are preserved without modification
5. Complex philosophical passages are broken for readability

## Next Steps

1. Editor review for pacing and flow
2. Adjust any panels that might benefit from different breaks
3. Ensure consistency with overall graphic novel style
4. Consider page layout implications for multi-panel scenes
