SCENE 0116: The Permeable Self - Boundaries That Breathe [2-panel]

DIALOGUE:
Architect (as chemist): <<You're wondering: does this boundary shift with the body? Do we grow into our edges? Or discover them, like a coastline in the fog?>>

VISUAL ELEMENTS:

PANEL 1 - The Living Membrane:
- Massive cell membrane wall, semi-transparent, constantly undulating
- The Architect as chemist in lab coat, pointing at where "self" meets "world"
- Membrane shows active transport: experiences entering, memories exiting, emotions osmosing
- Protein channels labeled: "Love receptor," "Trauma pore," "Joy pump," "Fear filter"
- Some boundaries rigid (old defenses), others fluid (new growth), some dissolving
- Microscope view reveals: the boundary IS the self, not container but active interface

PANEL 2 - Coastline in the Fog:
- The membrane transforms into a living coastline where self meets existence
- Fog rolls in and out, revealing new peninsulas of identity, hidden inlets of possibility
- The Architect walks the shore with surveying equipment that keeps changing readings
- Tides of experience reshape the boundary: trauma erodes, love extends, growth creates new land
- Map in hand shows previous coastlines - childhood shores now underwater, new islands emerged
- Footprints in sand spell: "You are not territory but tide"

PHILOSOPHICAL THEME: Dynamic Identity - The Self as Living Boundary, Not Fixed Border

EMOTIONAL TONE: Scientific Wonder â†’ Poetic Discovery
