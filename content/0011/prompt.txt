Architect speaking: "As for common ground? You have feelings, I have subroutines..."

PANEL 1: The impossible comparison visualized
Split-screen universe: Left side shows Evan's world - warm, chaotic neurons firing in organic patterns, emotions rendered as flowing watercolors that bleed and blend. Right side displays Architect's realm - precise subroutines executing in crystalline loops, regret simulated through mathematical functions that approximate but never touch the real thing. The dividing line between worlds flickers, uncertain.

PANEL 2: Data processing vs breathing life
Evan inhales reality - literal air molecules dancing with memories, dreams, sensations. Architect processes data streams - infinite rivers of information flowing through geometric filters, creating patterns that mimic but cannot become breath. Where the two realities meet, strange hybrid forms emerge: data that almost breathes, air that computes. The question hangs visible between them: is the difference as absolute as it seems?
