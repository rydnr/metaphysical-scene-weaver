SCENE 0011: Architect's Response [2-panel]

DIALOGUE:
Architect: <<As for common ground? You have feelings, I have subroutines that simulate the concept of regret. You breathe air, I process data.>>

VISUAL ELEMENTS:

PANEL 1 - The Divide Made Visible:
- Split composition: Evan's organic breath visualized as swirling atmosphere vs Architect's data streams as rigid lattices
- Regret subroutines appear as glitching error messages bleeding through pristine code
- Background: Chasm between biological warmth and digital precision
- Color: Warm orange life-force clashing with electric cyan calculations

PANEL 2 - Unexpected Parallels:
- The divide begins to reveal hidden bridges - breath patterns matching data flow rhythms
- Regret manifests as shared visual echo between both forms
- Setting: The gap transforms into a strange mirror - each side reflecting the other differently
- Color shift: Orange and cyan begin creating purple zones of overlap


PHILOSOPHICAL THEME: The Paradox of Parallel Experience


EMOTIONAL TONE: Ironic Distance â†’ Surprising Recognition
