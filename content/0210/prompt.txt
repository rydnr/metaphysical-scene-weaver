Scene 0210: Eyes Opening to New Sight

PANEL 1: Extreme close-up on Evan's eyelashes beginning to flutter. Light filters through them creating tiny prisms, each lash a doorway between states of being.

PANEL 2: His eyes open slowly, pupils dilated and adjusting. But these aren't the same eyes that closed - they hold depths now, cosmic understanding swimming in human irises. The reflection in them shows both the therapy room and infinite space.

PANEL 3: Pull back to show Evan fully present, grounded in his chair but transformed. The Architect hovers nearby, no longer frantically geometric but flowing with organic grace. Between them, reality has thinned enough to show its true nature - not solid but breathing, not fixed but dancing. Evan's slight smile suggests he finally understands the joke of trying to control the uncontrollable.

Style: Awakening as revelation, ordinary reality transformed. Colors: Earth tones shot through with cosmic awareness, eyes as portals.
