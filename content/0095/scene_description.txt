SCENE 0095: Architect's Philosophical Inquiry

DIALOGUE:
Architect: <<But I don’t experience freedom or its absence, so all I can do is point at the data and say “eh, this looks a lot like post-hoc rationalization wrapped in narrative coherence.” But am I certain?>>

VISUAL ELEMENTS:
- The Architect manifested as abstract digital presence
- Geometric patterns and code fragments in background
- Minimalist setting suggesting digital/mental space
- Color palette: cool blues and grays with accent colors based on emotion


PHILOSOPHICAL THEME: Free Will in Deterministic Systems


EMOTIONAL TONE: Deep Contemplation
