Scene 163: The Social Fiction

Create a 2-panel satirical visualization of how "who I am" functions as social performance:

Panel 1: Airport as identity theater - travelers wearing visible masks of their curated selves
Panel 2: Dinner party with true selves as ghosts while bodies perform social scripts

Show the necessity and absurdity of maintaining multiple personas across different social contexts.
