SCENE 163: The Social Fiction [2-panel]

DIALOGUE:
Architect: <<"Who I am"â€”the persona, the social fiction, the curated highlight reel you use to get through airports, dinner parties, and awkward text conversations.>>

VISUAL ELEMENTS:

PANEL 1 - Airport Identity Theater:
- Travelers wearing literal masks of curated selves
- Professional smiles, vacation personas, business identities
- Each person performing for invisible audiences
- Security checkpoint as identity verification theater
- Color: Sterile airport fluorescent mixed with mask artificiality

PANEL 2 - Multi-Platform Performance:
- Dinner party where true selves float as ghosts above
- Bodies below performing rehearsed social scripts
- Phones showing different personas for different platforms
- Each guest maintaining multiple simultaneous identities
- Color shift: Warm dinner lighting contrasting cold digital glow

PHILOSOPHICAL THEME: The Necessity of Social Fiction
We maintain elaborate "who" performances not from dishonesty but from social necessity - the lubrication that allows complex society to function.

EMOTIONAL TONE: Satirical Clarity
Seeing through social performance with humor rather than judgment.
