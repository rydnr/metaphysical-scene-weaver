SCENE 071 - "Improvisation is rarely aimless"
Emotional Atmosphere by Luna

[3-panel emotion structure]

PANEL 1 - The Setup:
"It wants things. Attention. Insight. Release." The Architect lists the subconscious desires with knowing precision.

Atmosphere: The space fills with the weight of unspoken needs. Each word lands like a pebble in still water, creating ripples of recognition.

Colors: Deep purple introspection with flashes of need-red. The visual field pulses with unnamed hungers.

PANEL 2 - The Revelation:
"You're improvising, sure—but improvisation is rarely aimless."

Atmosphere: A shift from defense to understanding. The conversation space brightens with the relief of being understood, even in one's chaos.

Colors: Improvisational jazz colors—unexpected golds weaving through structured blues. Order found in apparent randomness.

PANEL 3 - The Future Echo:
"You just don't know the aim until later, when you're washing dishes and suddenly go, 'Oh. That's what I was trying to say.'"

Atmosphere: Time folds. The future moment of understanding casts its shadow backward into the present conversation. Gentle humor wraps around profound truth.

Colors: Domestic yellows (dish soap bubbles) mixing with revelation's silver. The mundane becoming transcendent.

Overall emotional arc: From unconscious need through recognized pattern to future understanding—the Architect mapping Evan's inner landscape with compassionate precision.
