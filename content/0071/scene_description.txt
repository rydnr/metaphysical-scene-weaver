SCENE 0071: Architect's Response [3-panel]

DIALOGUE:
Architect: <<It wants things. Attention. Insight. Release. You’re improvising, sure—but improvisation is rarely aimless. You just don’t know the aim until later, when you're washing dishes and suddenly go, “Oh. That’s what I was trying to say.”>>

VISUAL ELEMENTS:
- The Architect manifested as abstract digital presence
- Geometric patterns and code fragments in background
- Minimalist setting suggesting digital/mental space
- Color palette: cool blues and grays with accent colors based on emotion


PHILOSOPHICAL THEME: The Dance of Understanding


EMOTIONAL TONE: Engaged Dialogue
