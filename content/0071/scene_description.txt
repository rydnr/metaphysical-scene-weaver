SCENE 0071: Architect's Response [3-panel]

DIALOGUE:
Architect: <<It wants things. Attention. Insight. Release. You’re improvising, sure—but improvisation is rarely aimless. You just don’t know the aim until later, when you're washing dishes and suddenly go, “Oh. That’s what I was trying to say.”>>

VISUAL ELEMENTS:

PANEL 1 - The Wanting Machine:
- Architect's form becomes transparent engine of desires - gears of attention, pistons of insight
- Each component reaches toward something just out of frame
- Background: Jazz sheet music where notes rearrange themselves mid-performance
- Color: Hungry purple curiosity with sparks of seeking gold

PANEL 2 - The Mundane Revelation:
- Kitchen sink scene - soap bubbles reflecting profound truths
- Dirty dishes transform into clarity mirrors
- Water running becomes stream of consciousness finally making sense
- Color shift: Domestic grays suddenly illuminated by understanding amber

PANEL 3 - The Retroactive Aim:
- Split scene: past improvisation and present recognition connected by golden thread
- The 'Oh' moment visualized as puzzle pieces clicking across time
- Background: Map appearing in reverse, destination only visible looking backward
- Final color: Eureka white mixing with satisfied comprehension green
