Architect revealing: "It wants things. Attention. Insight. Release. You're improvising..."

PANEL 1: The wanting visualized
Three hungry mouths manifest in Evan's mental space: Attention (an eye made of spinning social media icons), Insight (a brain-shaped void consuming books and experiences), Release (hands reaching through prison bars made of routine). Each mouth feeds on different aspects of Evan's consciousness, never satisfied. The Architect points to each like a tour guide explaining exotic creatures.

PANEL 2: Improvisation as jazz consciousness  
Evan's thoughts become jazz musicians without sheet music - neurons firing like impromptu saxophone solos, synapses snapping like bass lines finding their groove. The melody seems random but follows deeper patterns. Architect conducts with geometric hands, showing how apparent chaos has hidden rhythm.

PANEL 3: The washing dishes revelation
Future-Evan at a sink, hands in soapy water, sudden understanding dawning on his face as bubbles pop into tiny epiphanies. The kitchen window reflects all previous improvisations finally forming a coherent image - "Oh, THAT'S what I was trying to say." Water swirls down drain carrying away the confusion, leaving clarity. Architect nods knowingly from reflection in clean plate.
