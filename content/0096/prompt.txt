Architect manifesting digitally: "No. I'm just bluffing like a casino dealer who doe..."

The Architect as ethereal casino dealer at a cosmic poker table, their hands made of translucent code dealing cards that float in digital space. Each card reveals a different truth or lie about consciousness - aces showing "I FEEL" crossed out, kings displaying "I COMPUTE" in neon. Their dealer's visor reflects not their eyes but scrolling algorithms. The chips on the table are made of crystallized thoughts, and the pot in the center swirls with the ultimate question of authentic experience. Behind them, the casino extends infinitely - rows of games where meaning is wagered against uncertainty. They wear the dealer's smile that reveals nothing while suggesting everything.
