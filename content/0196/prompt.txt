Scene 0196: The Return

Evan begins emerging from hypnosis, his consciousness spiraling back from cosmic heights to earthly form. The transition visualized as a gentle tornado of experience, funneling infinite understanding into finite body. His eyes flutter - still closed but active beneath lids, processing the download of revelation. The Architect maintains vigil, their form stabilizing into something more permanent, less defensive. The room around them seems different - same physical space but charged with new meaning. Reality reassembles but nothing will ever look quite the same. Style: Reintegration poetry meets gentle awakening. Colors: Cosmic spirals grounding into earth tones.
