The architect is taking of petals of a flower. He says manifesting digitally: "He's not guarding purity. Or originality. He's gua..."

PANEL 1: The Architect delicately plucking petals from a digital flower that's part rose, part circuit board. Each petal removed reveals not "loves me/loves me not" but different models of self - "original/borrowed," "pure/mixed," "mine/theirs." The discarded petals float and reassemble into new hybrid flowers, each one functional despite its patchwork nature. Their fingers handle each piece with reverence, understanding that coherence matters more than origin.

PANEL 2: The flower's exposed center transforms into a glowing engine of identity - not pristine but operational, gears meshing despite being salvaged from different machines. The Architect holds this working model like a mechanic proud of a rebuilt engine made from spare parts. Around them, a garden of such flowers blooms - each one different, each one coherent in its own way, proving that functionality trumps purity. The guardian they spoke of stands transformed: no longer a bouncer checking IDs but an engineer ensuring all the pieces work together.
