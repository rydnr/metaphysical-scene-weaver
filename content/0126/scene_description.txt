SCENE 0126: The Working Model - Coherence Over Purity [2-panel]

DIALOGUE:
Architect (plucking petals): <<He's not guarding purity. Or originality. He's guarding coherence. A working model.>>

VISUAL ELEMENTS:

PANEL 1 - Deconstructing the Ideal:
- The Architect plucking petals from a "perfect" flower labeled "Pure Original Self"
- Each petal reveals it was artificial, made of different materials: plastic, paper, metal, glass
- Petals float away labeled: "Myth of authenticity," "Illusion of uniqueness," "Fantasy of purity"
- The flower's stem shown to be assembled from recycled parts, held by industrial glue
- Other "pure" flowers in a garden revealed as elaborate constructions
- Ground littered with discarded ideal selves that couldn't function

PANEL 2 - The Beautiful Machine:
- The Architect now tending a strange hybrid flower - part organic, part mechanical
- This flower works: gears mesh smoothly, circuits connect, roots draw real nourishment
- Petals are obviously borrowed: one from mother, one from culture, one from trauma, one from joy
- But together they form a functioning system that processes light into energy
- The flower's imperfection is its strength - adaptable, repairable, honest
- Background: A greenhouse of other "working models," each unique in its assembled coherence

PHILOSOPHICAL THEME: Functional Truth - The Beauty of What Actually Works Over What Should Be Pure

EMOTIONAL TONE: Deconstructive Clarity â†’ Pragmatic Appreciation
