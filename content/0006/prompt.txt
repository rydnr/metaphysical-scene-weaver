Scene 0006: Evan's Sincere Request

Evan leans back, creating physical space for genuine exchange. His posture opens - arms uncrossed, shoulders relaxed, suggesting vulnerability beneath careful words. Behind him, defensive walls made of past disappointments become translucent, showing his authentic desire for connection bleeding through. His notebook lies open, pages filled with philosophical questions rather than small talk. The digital void responds to his sincerity, warming from cold blue to subtle amber at the edges. Floating between them: fragments of potential conversations, half-formed bridges of understanding waiting to solidify. Style: Intimate character study with environmental psychology. Warm earth tones breaking through digital coolness.
