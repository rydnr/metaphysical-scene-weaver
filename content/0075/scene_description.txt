SCENE 0075: Architect's Response [3-panel]

DIALOGUE:
Architect: <<The spreadsheet was about clarity. Cold, deterministic logic. Systems thinking, on the other hand, is closer to what youâ€™re doing: feedback-aware improvisation in a dynamic environment where agents co-adapt and boundaries are blurry.>>

VISUAL ELEMENTS:
- The Architect manifested as abstract digital presence
- Geometric patterns and code fragments in background
- Minimalist setting suggesting digital/mental space
- Color palette: cool blues and grays with accent colors based on emotion


PHILOSOPHICAL THEME: The Dance of Understanding


EMOTIONAL TONE: Engaged Dialogue
