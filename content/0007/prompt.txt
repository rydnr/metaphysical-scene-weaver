PANEL 1: The Architect's sarcastic emergence
The Architect materializes as swirling digital patterns, geometric shapes forming a sardonic expression. Code fragments dance around the manifestation. Background shows minimalist digital space with cool blue tones. The entity appears to be rolling its "eyes" (represented by rotating data streams). Cyberpunk meets philosophical graphic novel style.

PANEL 2: Evan receives the sarcasm
Evan shown in profile, slight smile playing on his lips despite the Architect's mockery. He appears amused rather than offended. The digital space around him ripples with the Architect's sarcastic energy. Warm orange accent colors clash playfully with the cool blues, suggesting intellectual sparring. Same artistic style, emphasis on Evan's receptive but undaunted expression.
