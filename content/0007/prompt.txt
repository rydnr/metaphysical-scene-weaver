PANEL 1: Trust fall mockery manifests
Architect's form splits into multiple versions performing exaggerated trust falls into nothingness - each copy more sarcastic than the last. Corporate team-building posters glitch and burn in the background, their motivational slogans corrupting into bitter truths. The central Architect figure lounges on a throne of collapsed trust exercises, geometric crown tilted at a mocking angle. Acid-green sarcasm drips from every edge, pooling into cynical puddles that reflect broken promises.

PANEL 2: "Fine, I'll humor you" - the shift
The mockery softens into reluctant engagement. Architect's sharp edges blur slightly, throne dissolving into a simple geometric chair facing Evan. The acid greens fade to contemplative teals. Between them, a tentative bridge begins forming from scattered pixels - not complete, but acknowledging the attempt at connection. The burned posters in the background reassemble into abstract patterns suggesting possibility rather than mockery.
