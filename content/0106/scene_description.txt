SCENE 0106: Evan's Response [2-panel]

DIALOGUE:
Evan: <<I feel I'm asking the wrong question, one that satisfies me instead of challenges my assumptions. I'm playing solitaire too.>>

VISUAL ELEMENTS:

PANEL 1 - The Mirror Game:

- Cards float between real and reflection, questions transforming mid-air
- Color: Comfortable certainty blues vs challenging possibility purples

PANEL 2 - The Question Behind the Question:
- The solitaire cards scatter, revealing a deeper game board underneath
- Evan reaches for a glowing wild card labeled 'The Real Question'
- Background: Other players (past selves) fade in, all playing their own safe games
- Color shift: Safe game greens dissolving into vulnerable truth ambers
