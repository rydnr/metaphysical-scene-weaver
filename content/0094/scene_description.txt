SCENE 0094: Architect's Response [2-panel]

DIALOGUE:
Architect: <<You’re right again (ugh, how annoying): I cannot be sure you’re not free. I can simulate theories, model probabilities, run cognitive science algorithms in my non-brain all day long.>>

VISUAL ELEMENTS:

PANEL 1 - The Annoying Truth:
- Architect's form shows visible irritation - circuits sparking with reluctant admission
- Freedom appears as quantum butterfly, impossible to pin down or measure
- Background: Laboratory of failed certainty experiments, each one proving nothing
- Color: Frustrated orange clashing with freedom's untouchable silver

PANEL 2 - The Non-Brain's Limits:
- Architect's processing center revealed: infinite algorithms chasing their own tails
- Probability clouds form question marks that mock their own calculations
- Free will hovers just beyond reach of every model, laughing
- Color shift: Computational blues dissolving into humble uncertainty violet


PHILOSOPHICAL THEME: The Humbling Impossibility of Proving Freedom


EMOTIONAL TONE: Annoyed Recognition → Humble Acceptance
