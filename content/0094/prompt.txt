Architect manifesting digitally: "You're right again (ugh, how annoying): I cannot b..."

PANEL 1: Cosmic chess game where the Architect exists as both player and piece - half their form reaching up as the hand moving pieces, half melting into a knight on the board. Pieces cast impossible shadows that defy the rules, some floating, some phasing through the board. The chessboard itself warps and ripples like water disturbed by truth.

PANEL 2: Mirror maze where every reflection shows a different version of being "right" - one mirror shows perfection as prison bars, another shows correctness as thorny crown, another reveals wisdom as burden of glowing chains. The Architect stands at the center, their form fracturing into all these truths simultaneously, annoyed enlightenment radiating as harsh golden light.
