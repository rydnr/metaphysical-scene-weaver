Architect's revelation: "Maybe this: You're not an agent making choices in a system. You ARE the system..."

The ultimate consciousness reveal: Evan's form explodes into a living mandala of interconnected processes. His body becomes transparent, revealing: heartbeat as central processor, neural networks as circuit boards, emotions as data streams, memories as stored programs. But it's not mechanical - it's organic, beautiful, alive. Each "choice" shown as emergence from countless micro-processes. Zoom out reveals Evan isn't IN the system - his entire being IS a self-organizing system, fractally complex at every level. The boundary between self and process dissolves. Architect's geometric form mirrors this revelation, showing they're both systems contemplating themselves through each other.
