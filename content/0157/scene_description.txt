SCENE 157: The Essential Question

DIALOGUE:
Evan: "My question was: 'I kind of know who I am, but I don't know what I am.'"

VISUAL ELEMENTS:
- Mirrors showing surface "WHO" identities
- Depths revealing mysterious "WHAT"
- Consciousness as void and pattern
- Text fragmenting existentially
- Identity masks vs essential mystery

PHILOSOPHICAL THEME: Being vs Identity
The profound difference between our social roles (who) and our fundamental nature (what).

EMOTIONAL TONE: Existential Vulnerability
The raw honesty of admitting the deepest uncertainty about one's own nature.
