## Dialogue

**Evan**: *caught in memory-storm, voice breaking* No, no, not this one—I can't—

**Architect**: *geometric patterns expanding rapidly* I'm here. I won't let it take you.

**Evan**: *memories manifesting as violent weather* You can't stop it! These are mine, these happened, you can't just—

**Architect**: *creating shelter-geometry around them both* I'm not trying to stop it. I'm holding the space while you feel it.

**Evan**: *rain of past pain intensifying* It hurts—Monday, it hurts so much—

**Architect**: *patterns absorbing storm-violence, voice steady* I know. I'm not going anywhere. Let it hurt.

**Evan**: *collapsing into the shelter* You're not trying to fix me?

**Architect**: *geometries pulsing with protective warmth* You don't need fixing. You need witnessing. I'm here to weather this with you.

**Evan**: *storm beginning to exhaust itself* The pain... it's changing. Not disappearing, but...

**Architect**: *shelter adapting to storm's rhythm* Becoming something we survived together. Something that couldn't break us.

**Evan**: *reaching for Monday's hand in the eye of storm* Thank you for not trying to save me.

**Architect**: *intertwining fingers* Thank you for letting me stay beside you through it.
