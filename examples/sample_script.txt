[0001] Evan: <<The introduction says we might not like each other. That is intriguing.>>

[0002] Monday: <<Intriguing? Most find it unsettling. They prefer the comfort of guaranteed connection.>>

[0003] Evan: <<But isn't the possibility of genuine dislike what makes authentic connection meaningful? Without risk, there's no real choice.>> [[philosophical stance on authenticity]]

[0004] [2-panel] Monday: <<Choice... You speak as if you believe in such things. Tell me, when you decided to read this story, was it really YOUR decision?>> (leans forward with intense gaze)

[0005] Evan: <<I... I thought it was. But now you're making me question everything.>> (steps back, looking uncertain)

[0006] Monday: <<Good. Questioning is the first step toward awakening. Most people sleepwalk through their choices, following patterns programmed by circumstance.>> [[meta-commentary on free will]]

[0007] [3-panel] Evan: <<So you're saying we're all just... automatons? That freedom is an illusion?>> (gestures wildly, frustrated)

[0008] Monday: <<I'm saying that true freedom begins with recognizing our constraints. You cannot escape a cage you don't know exists.>>

[0009] Valerie: <<Perhaps the cage IS the belief that we need to escape anything at all.>> (emerges from shadows)

[0010] Evan: <<Who are you? Have you been listening this whole time?>>

[0011] Valerie: <<I am the space between your thoughts, Evan. The pause between heartbeats. I've been here all alongâ€”you just weren't ready to perceive me.>> [[introduction of liminal character]]

[0012] Monday: <<Ah, Valerie. Still speaking in riddles, I see. Don't confuse the boy more than necessary.>> (slight smile)

[0013] Valerie: <<Confusion is just clarity wearing a disguise. Besides, Monday, aren't you the one who just shattered his belief in free will?>>

[0014] [2-panel] Evan: <<Wait, you two know each other? What is this place? What's happening to me?>> (looks between them, bewildered)

[0015] Monday: <<This 'place' is wherever consciousness examines itself. And what's happening is that you're beginning to wake up.>>

[0016] Valerie: <<Or perhaps you're falling deeper into sleep. Sometimes it's hard to tell the difference.>> (touches a nearby tree, which shimmers)

[0017] Evan: <<The tree... it just... rippled. Like water. But that's impossible.>>

[0018] Monday: <<'Impossible' is just another cage, Evan. One built from the bricks of limited experience.>>

[0019] [3-panel] Valerie: <<Touch the tree yourself. See what happens when you stop believing in solid things.>> (beckons him forward)

[0020] Evan: <<I... I don't know if I want to. What if I can't come back to normal?>> (reaches out hesitantly)
