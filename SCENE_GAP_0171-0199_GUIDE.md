```

```json
{
  "scene_number": NUMBER,
  "title": "Evocative Scene Title",

## Quality Guidelines

### Use Our Resources
1. **transformation_highlights.md** - Study the successful metaphors
2. **reference_image_prompts.json** - Maintain visual consistency
3. **places.json** - Use our 15 philosophical locations meaningfully

### Avoid the Old Patterns
‚ùå "Abstract digital presence"
‚ùå "Minimalist setting"
‚ùå "Cool blues and grays"
‚ùå "Engaged Dialogue"

### Embrace the New
‚úÖ Specific, vivid metaphors
‚úÖ Philosophical locations with purpose
‚úÖ Narrator as active presence
‚úÖ Each scene advancing the journey

## Location Distribution Suggestion

Rotate through our philosophical spaces:
- digital_void (scenes exploring pure potential)
- threshold_cafe (liminal conversations)
- memory_swamp (processing difficult truths)
- fractal_library (recursive understanding)
- identity_bazaar (questioning constructed selves)
- boundary_dissolution_pool (ego death moments)
- consensus_reality_checkpoint (challenging assumptions)
- void_workshop (creating from nothing)
- yesterday's_tomorrow (confronting lost futures)

## Remember

Each scene should:
1. Advance the philosophical journey
2. Use unique, specific imagery
3. Give the narrator something interesting to observe
4. Create panel opportunities for artists
5. Connect to our larger narrative of consciousness exploring itself
