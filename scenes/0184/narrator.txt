The return to ordinary consciousness brings extraordinary surprise.

"Afterwards, he wanted to talk about something I was not expecting."

Evan sits up now, the horizontal surrender of hypnosis replaced by vertical attention. The physical shift mirrors the psychological: from receiving to processing, from depth to surface, from journey to integration. But the integration refuses to follow expected patterns.

We enter these spaces—therapy, meditation, plant medicine, hypnosis—with unconscious scripts about what we'll find. Usually variations on the themes we already know: childhood wounds, relationship patterns, fears and desires we've catalogued before. We prepare ourselves for certain revelations, armor ourselves against particular truths.

But authentic wisdom refuses our stage directions. The voice that spoke of change incarnate, that scolded spiritual materialism, that counseled healing over protection—this voice has its own agenda. And now, in the aftermath of profound encounter, it wants to discuss something off-script.

The surprise in Evan's expression suggests more than simple unexpectedness. It's the particular disorientation of having our spiritual assumptions overturned. We think we know what the deep self wants to discuss. We think we've mapped the territory of our own unconscious. Then the voice speaks of something we hadn't even known to expect.

This is often how real change enters: not through the doors we've been watching but through windows we didn't know existed. The unexpected topic—whatever it might be—carries special significance precisely because Evan hadn't prepared defenses against it.

In the therapy room, now fully returned to consensus reality, the surprise lingers. What does the deepest self want to discuss when it's finished with our rehearsed concerns? What matters to the voice that speaks from beyond ego's careful preparations?

The answer waits in the space after "expecting," in the pause where preconceptions dissolve and genuine discovery becomes possible.
