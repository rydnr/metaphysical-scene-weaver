"The question spreads through the city like beneficial contagion, each person catching their own variant of wonder."

Evan walks through downtown crowds with new perception, watching the question propagate in ways he never imagined. A businessman pauses mid-stride, struck by sudden self-reflection. A mother pushing a stroller gets the distant look of someone hearing the question for the first time. The spiral's influence extends far beyond its physical boundaries.

It's not that Evan is causing this—he's simply seeing what was always happening. The question "What am I?" moves through human consciousness like wind through leaves, touching each person differently, awakening what was already waiting to wake. His transformed relationship with the question has given him eyes to see its universal movement.

"Beneficial contagion"—not disease but cure spreading. Where existential uncertainty once seemed like affliction, Evan now recognizes it as humanity's strange blessing. The capacity to question our own existence is what makes us human, what drives art, philosophy, love, growth. The question is feature, not bug.

A teenager sits on steps, earbuds in but music paused, clearly wrestling with identity in that particularly acute adolescent way. Evan remembers that age, when "What am I?" felt like emergency requiring immediate answer. Now he sees the beauty in that urgency, the necessity of that early grappling.

"Each person catching their own variant"—the question mutates to fit each life. For the businessman: "What am I beyond my success?" For the mother: "What am I becoming through parenthood?" For the teenager: "What am I if not what others expect?" Same essential question, infinite personal variations.

The city reveals itself as vast laboratory where consciousness experiments with self-awareness. Every coffee shop contains someone journaling through identity crisis. Every gym has someone trying to answer the question through physical transformation. Every bar holds someone attempting to dissolve the question in alcohol, only to find it waiting in the morning, patient and unchanged.

Evan passes a bookstore, its philosophy section full of attempts to answer what can't be answered. He smiles, remembering his own desperate consumption of texts, seeking the book that would finally explain him to himself. Now he understands: the books too are part of the question, not its answer.

"Wonder"—the question's ultimate gift. Not the torment of not knowing but the wonder of being able to wonder. Each person touched by the question gains capacity for awe at their own existence. The question cracks open the shell of taking oneself for granted.

A street artist creates portraits that capture something beyond physical features—she's painting the question in each face, the mystery each person carries. Her subjects leave with images of their own wondering, external mirrors of internal inquiry.

The contagion spreads through art, conversation, silent recognition. Two strangers' eyes meet on the subway, sharing momentary acknowledgment of mutual mystery. A teacher pauses mid-lecture, struck by the question of who's really teaching. A chef seasoning soup wonders what consciousness tastes its own creations.

"Through the city"—but really through all cities, all places where humans gather and generate sufficient density for the question to leap between minds. Urban spaces accelerate the transmission, but the question moves through rural areas too, perhaps more slowly but just as surely.

Evan realizes he's witnessing evolution in real time. Not biological but consciousness evolution, the question serving as mutation that pushes awareness toward greater complexity. Each person who genuinely engages "What am I?" adds to humanity's collective capacity for self-reflection.

But it's beneficial even when painful. The businessman's crisis might lead to more authentic life. The mother's questioning might deepen her presence with her child. The teenager's identity struggles are necessary passage to adult self-awareness. The question hurts and heals simultaneously.

Some try to avoid infection, building elaborate identities to ward off the question's approach. But the question is patient, finding cracks in every armor. Success, failure, love, loss—all create openings where the question can enter and begin its transformative work.

The city hums with questioning. Not audibly but palpably, the frequency of consciousness examining itself. Evan walks through this field of inquiry, no longer isolated in his questioning but part of vast community of wonderers, all infected with beneficial uncertainty.

What am I that sees the question everywhere? What are you that spreads through awareness like healing virus? What is this city where every street corner is philosophy department, every human a philosopher whether they know it or not?

The beneficial contagion continues its ancient spread, using Evan's eyes to witness its movement, using his transformed relationship with the question to recognize its universal benefit. The cure for existential crisis turns out to be deeper engagement with the crisis itself. The question saves us from the poverty of easy answers.
