"You seem different lately. More... present? Even in these boring meetings."

The colleague's observation cuts through workplace small talk to something deeper. In the fluorescent-lit break room, amid coffee makers and microwaves, they've noticed transformation. Not dramatic change but subtle shift—presence where absence once lived.

The specification "even in these boring meetings" reveals the unusualness. Most people mentally escape tedious work moments. Evan's presence during mundane activities stands out precisely because it's so rare.

"What's your secret?"

The question assumes technique, method, something that can be transmitted. The colleague seeks practical wisdom—perhaps meditation app, productivity hack, pharmaceutical assist. They expect answer fitting break room conversation.

"No secret. Just stopped dividing life into 'real' and 'not real' parts."

This response reframes entire understanding. No technique but perspective shift. The division between significant and insignificant moments—that arbitrary line we draw through experience—dissolved. All moments equally real.

Watching cream spiral in coffee becomes demonstration. This simple act contains same mystery as any profound meditation. Patterns forming and dissolving, separate becoming unified—the cosmic dance plays out in coffee cup.

"This coffee, this conversation, that spreadsheet—they're all answers to 'What am I?'"

The radical inclusion of spreadsheet as spiritual teaching shocks through ordinariness. We expect awakening to transcend Excel, not include it. But Evan finds the eternal question answered through quarterly projections.

"I am someone who drinks coffee."

Simple statement contains profound acceptance. Not "I am consciousness temporarily inhabiting body that drinks coffee" but direct identification with ordinary act. The sacred doesn't transcend the mundane—it inhabits it fully.

"I am someone who attends meetings."

Even this—the most mocked aspect of corporate life—becomes identity statement. Not with resignation but recognition. If consciousness chooses to manifest as meeting attender, who argues with existence?

"I am someone who finds the eternal in Excel formulas."

This achievement—finding eternal in Excel—represents integration's pinnacle. Not escaping to mountaintop but discovering summit in spreadsheet cell. The infinite hides in functions and formulas.

"The question doesn't take breaks for work hours."

Indeed, "What am I?" operates continuously, not respecting our divisions between spiritual and secular time. It asks through alarm clocks and commutes, through emails and deadlines. Every moment offers fresh answer.

"So you're saying enlightenment includes quarterly reports?"

The colleague's half-joking response reveals dawning recognition. If enlightenment excludes large portions of life, how enlightened can it be? True awakening must include everything or it's just another escape fantasy.

"Especially quarterly reports!"

Evan's enthusiasm for including the most mundane aspects reveals integration's joy. Not despite quarterly reports but through them. They become vehicle for presence rather than obstacle to it.

"Where else do we practice being human?"

This question reorients spiritual practice. Not in special locations but wherever we find ourselves. The office becomes monastery, the cubicle becomes cell, the workplace becomes practice place.

"This IS the spiritual path—emails and all."

The inclusive "all" leaves nothing outside awakening's scope. Every email becomes opportunity for presence. Every spreadsheet offers fresh canvas for consciousness. Every meeting provides sangha.

"I'm someone who finds meaning in TPS reports because meaning isn't in the reports—it's in the finding."

This distinction between content and process transforms understanding. Meaning doesn't hide in special places waiting discovery—it emerges through quality of attention brought to any content. TPS reports become meaningful through meaningful engagement.

"The sacred hides in plain sight, dressed in business casual."

This final image perfectly captures integration's achievement. The sacred doesn't wear special robes or speak Sanskrit. It dresses like everyone else, speaks corporate jargon, attends mandatory trainings.

The fluorescent dharma—harsh office lights as illumination—suggests awakening adapts to any lighting condition. We need not wait for candlelight and incense. Fluorescent tubes illuminate truth as effectively as any flame.

Coffee meditation in break room as temple shows how any space becomes sacred through presence. The break room's transient nature—people coming and going—mirrors life's impermanence as clearly as any Buddhist teaching.

The cubicle monastery reveals workplace as legitimate practice space. Monks in cells, workers in cubicles—both provide structure for consciousness to explore itself through limitation and routine.

This ordinary glory—transcendence without escape—represents mature spirituality. Not fleeing the world but finding freedom within it. Not special states but presence in all states.

This scene achieves what many seek—practical mysticism. How does enlightenment look at work? Like this: present in meetings, aware while spreadsheeting, finding cosmos in coffee breaks.

The colleague's recognition opens possibility. If Evan can find sacred in TPS reports, perhaps anyone can. Awakening becomes democratized, available in any moment, requiring no special conditions.

In this break room conversation, we witness spirituality's integration with modern life. The question "What am I?" doesn't require retreats or robes. It asks and answers through everyday activities.

And so the sacred spreads through offices, sanctifying spreadsheets, blessing break rooms, enlightening emails. The question continues its work through working humans, finding fresh expressions in fiscal years and filing systems.

"What am I?" asks existence through quarterly reports.
"I am this moment of attention," answers the awakened worker.
"What am I?" asks consciousness through coffee breaks.
"I am presence in fluorescent light," responds the integrated human.

The workplace transforms not through changing but through being seen clearly. Every cubicle contains infinity. Every meeting holds potential awakening. Every ordinary moment offers extraordinary answer to the eternal question of what we are.

In this recognition, work and spiritual practice merge. The question "What am I?" finds answer not in escaping daily life but in fully inhabiting it, discovering that presence transforms any content into sacred teaching.
