The therapy room transforms into an ocean of understanding, where depth is honored rather than feared.

"You're welcome, of course." The architect's disguise as an old-school therapist is perfect—tweed jacket, pipe, leather armchair, the whole Freudian theater. But his eyes betray something deeper: genuine recognition of what Evan has brought to this space.

Treasure maps to the deep sea of consciousness. What a perfect metaphor for these psychedelic reports, these attempts to bring back cartography from territories where ordinary language fails. Most therapists would pathologize such experiences, reduce them to neurochemistry, file them under "drug-induced hallucination" and move on. But the architect sees what they truly are: rare documentation of consciousness exploring itself.

"Does this mean anything?" The eternal question of the psychonaut, the mystic, the one who has touched something beyond ordinary perception. It's the question that can drive one mad if taken too literally, or set one free if held lightly. The architect chooses the path of poetic validation.

Slapping a poet for bleeding in meter. The image captures the absurdity of punishing someone for having experiences that overflow conventional containers. Some truths can only be spoken in metaphor, some territories can only be mapped in poetry. To demand prose from such expeditions is to misunderstand their nature entirely.

The office begins its subtle transformation. Bookshelves ripple like kelp forests. The carpet develops currents. The ceiling dissolves into oceanic depth. The architect isn't just receiving Evan's report—he's creating a space where such reports can be properly honored, where the deep sea of consciousness can momentarily surface in the therapeutic container.

This validation matters more than any interpretation could. Before one can integrate extraordinary experiences, one must first have them witnessed without judgment. The architect offers this witnessing with a combination of professional gravitas and cosmic humor that says: Yes, you went somewhere real. Yes, it matters. No, you're not crazy for caring about it.

The treasure map is acknowledged. The exploration is honored. The poetry is allowed to bleed in meter.
