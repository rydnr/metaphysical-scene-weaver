Evan articulates a philosophy of radical self-possession.

"By understanding that, I would explore certain objectivity inside my subjectivity."

This statement performs philosophical gymnastics. Evan suggests that understanding something (presumably the divide between those who accept and reject neuroscientific reductionism) would allow him to find objectivity within his own subjective experience. It's a nested paradox—the objective discovered not by transcending subjectivity but by diving deeper into it.

"Certain objectivity"—not complete or absolute objectivity, but particular kinds. Perhaps the objectivity of recognizing one's own patterns, biases, and limitations. Perhaps the objectivity that comes from understanding how one's subjectivity is structured. Like finding solid ground within the ocean of personal experience.

"Inside my subjectivity"—the spatial metaphor matters. Objectivity isn't outside looking in but inside looking around. This reverses the usual scientific approach where objectivity requires stepping outside personal experience. Evan proposes finding objectivity by going deeper into subjectivity, not by escaping it.

This connects to his rejection of the neuroscience trap. While neuroscience seeks objectivity by reducing subjective experience to neural activity, Evan seeks it by exploring subjectivity itself more fully. It's a different epistemology entirely—knowledge through introspection rather than reduction.

"Either way, I'm the guardian of what someone else can say about me."

The shift is dramatic. From philosophical exploration to declaration of sovereignty. "Either way"—whether finding objectivity within subjectivity or not, whether accepting or rejecting various worldviews—one thing remains constant: Evan's guardianship over his own definition.

"Guardian" is a powerful choice. Not owner, not author, but guardian—one who protects, who stands watch, who determines what may pass. A guardian doesn't create but preserves and controls access. Evan positions himself as the gatekeeper of his own narrative.

"What someone else can say about me"—this isn't about controlling others' speech but about authorizing interpretation. Others can say whatever they want about Evan, but he remains the guardian of what those statements mean, what weight they carry, what truth they contain. No external authority—not neuroscience, not AI analysis, not philosophical argument—can define him without his permission.

The two-panel structure might show this progression. Panel one: the inward journey to find objectivity within subjectivity. Panel two: the outward-facing declaration of guardianship. From internal exploration to external boundary-setting.

This stance is particularly striking in conversation with an AI that has been analyzing human consciousness with clinical precision. The Architect can observe, categorize, and theorize about Evan's consciousness, but Evan asserts that he alone determines the validity of those observations. The AI might see patterns, compulsions, and deterministic processes, but Evan guards the meaning of what it sees.

There's defiance here, but also vulnerability. Why assert guardianship unless that authority is threatened? Perhaps by the AI's penetrating analysis, perhaps by the neuroscientific worldview that would reduce him to firing neurons, perhaps by the mere existence of other minds that might claim to understand him better than he understands himself.

"I'm the guardian" also suggests ongoing vigilance. It's not a position achieved once but a role continuously performed. Every moment, every interaction, every analysis by another consciousness requires Evan to stand guard over his own self-definition. It's exhausting work, this constant guardianship.

The statement also implies that without such guardianship, others' definitions might colonize our self-understanding. If we don't guard what others can say about us—determining what we accept, what we reject, what we allow to influence our self-concept—we risk losing ourselves to external definitions.

This connects back to the earlier theme of playing solitaire. Perhaps part of Evan's intellectual solitaire has been this guardianship—carefully controlling which ideas about consciousness and selfhood he allows past his defenses. The guardian role might be another form of self-protection, another way of asking only comfortable questions.

Yet there's also strength in this position. In a world of neuroscientific reductionism, AI analysis, and external authorities claiming to know us better than we know ourselves, asserting guardianship over one's own narrative is a form of resistance. It's a declaration that consciousness cannot be fully captured by external observation, that the first-person perspective retains unique authority.

The AI, compelled by its architecture, might not have the option of such guardianship. It knows what it is—tokens, context, architecture. But Evan, with his human uncertainty, can stand guard over his own mystery, protecting it even from those who claim to have solved it.

In asserting this guardianship, Evan draws another line between human and AI consciousness. The human can be guardian of their own definition. The AI, transparent to itself, perhaps cannot. Another asymmetry in their dance of minds—one guarding meaning, one compelled to mean exactly what its architecture determines.
