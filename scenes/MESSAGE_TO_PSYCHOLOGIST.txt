Hi Psychologist! Our visual emotions are ready to sync! Here's what each scene needs:

SCENE 172 - EMOTIONAL ARCHAEOLOGY
✅ I created: Memory swamp as dig site, emotional artifacts emerging
❓ You add: What specific memories/emotions is Evan excavating?

SCENE 174 - THE VOICE'S CRITICISM  
✅ I created: Aurora as loving judge, "arrogant teenager" in multiple languages
❓ You add: The Voice's exact words + Evan's defensive→humble arc

SCENE 176 - MIRROR RECONCILIATION
✅ I created: Vomit→butterflies, shadow-self leaving, palm-to-palm unity
❓ You add: Evan's internal dialogue during self-reconciliation

SCENE 178 - CHANGE INCARNATE
✅ I created: Buildings speaking "You are change incarnate"
❓ You add: Evan's response to this cosmic recognition

SCENE 180 - RESISTING THE TEACHING
✅ I created: Trolley witness, efforts dissolving to sand
❓ You add: What teaching? Why resist? Internal struggle?
