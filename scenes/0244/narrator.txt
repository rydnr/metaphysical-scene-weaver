The architect's hands move in the universal gesture of slowing down—palms pressing gently against invisible resistance, creating space for wisdom to enter.

"If this were myth—and it is, by the way—"

This parenthetical changes everything. Not "like" myth, not "similar to" myth, but IS myth. The architect refuses the modern separation between symbolic and literal, between story and life. Evan's experience with the door isn't like something from mythology; it's mythology happening now, in real time, to real people who've forgotten they're living in stories.

The reframe liberates. If this is myth, then different rules apply. Heroes don't chase their mystical experiences; they integrate them. Protagonists don't grasp at vanished doors; they attend to what the door's appearance revealed about reality's nature.

"The next step wouldn't be to chase the door."

Here's wisdom that contradicts every instinct of the seeking mind. We want to recreate peak experiences, to find that door again, to force our way back to the ineffable. But chasing the mystical is like chasing your own shadow—the faster you run, the faster it flees. The door appeared when Evan wasn't looking for it. It will appear again, if it needs to, in its own time.

"It would be to listen."

Listen. Not seek, not strive, not practice techniques to recreate the experience. Listen. The architect prescribes the most difficult medicine for the modern mind—receptive attention without agenda. Listen to what? To everything. To the ordinary world that's never really ordinary. To the daily life that's always whispering secrets to those who slow down enough to hear.

The studio around them seems to demonstrate this teaching. Books that were just books moments ago now seem pregnant with meaning. Screens that displayed mere data now flicker with possibility. The ordinary world hasn't changed, but the quality of attention brought to it has transformed completely.

This is integration's secret: we don't need to return to the extraordinary. We need to recognize that we never left it. The door was extraordinary not because it led somewhere special but because it revealed that where we already are is special beyond comprehension. The myth continues. We're in it now. The only question is whether we're listening.
