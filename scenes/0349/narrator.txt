"Two levels up—enough to catch myself catching myself."

Evan returns to his fingers, using the same gesture from earlier but with different energy. Before, the counting seemed to measure limitation; now it catalogs capability. The physical act of counting grounds abstract recursion in bodily experience.

The phrase "catch myself catching myself" perfectly captures what two levels of meta-cognition allows. It's not infinite recursion but sufficient recursion—enough to observe the observer, to become aware of awareness itself. This double-catching prevents unconscious patterns from running unchecked.

"Three moves ahead—enough to see the pattern before I repeat it."

This temporal dimension complements the vertical recursion. Three moves of anticipation allows pattern recognition—seeing the shape of interactions before they fully unfold. It's not prophetic foresight but practical prediction, enough to avoid repetitive mistakes.

Looking up after counting suggests moving from internal calculation to external application. He's not just mapping his capabilities but considering their real-world utility. The upward gaze connects personal limits to lived experience.

"That's... actually enough for most of life, isn't it?"

The pause before "actually" shows surprise at this recognition. He's been so focused on what he can't do that he's missed the sufficiency of what he can do. The tag question invites confirmation while revealing growing confidence in his assessment.

The architect's small smile shows gentle amusement at Evan's discovery of what should have been obvious. There's no mockery, just the knowing expression of someone watching another find their way to simple truth through complex paths.

"More than enough. Most people navigate with less and do fine."

This observation provides crucial perspective. Evan's 2x3 capacity isn't minimal—it's above average. Most people don't consciously map their recursive limits or predictive capacity, yet they manage life successfully. His precision is advantage, not handicap.

"You're like someone worried they only have a flashlight in a cave, not realizing that's exactly what spelunkers use."

This analogy transforms the entire frame. Professional cave explorers—people who navigate darkness for a living—use flashlights, not floodlights. The tool Evan worried was insufficient is precisely calibrated for its purpose.

"Total illumination would blind you anyway."

This final point adds physiological wisdom to the metaphor. Too much light in a cave would eliminate depth perception, wash out details, make navigation harder not easier. Sometimes limitation enhances rather than restricts function.

The matter-of-fact tone delivers this comfort without drama. The architect isn't trying to console Evan but simply stating facts about tools and their uses. This practical approach grounds the philosophical in the everyday.

Evan's full relaxation shows complete somatic integration. The body that was tense with insufficiency can finally release into sufficiency. This isn't just intellectual understanding but full-system recognition of enough-ness.

"So my 2x3 flashlight is perfectly sized for human caves."

By claiming the flashlight as "my," Evan takes ownership of his particular capacities. The specification "human caves" shows he understands the scale-appropriateness—he's not trying to illuminate cosmic caverns but navigate human-sized passages.

"Bright enough to avoid walls, not so bright I lose the ability to sense beyond the light."

This sophisticated understanding recognizes that partial illumination has advantages. Total brightness would eliminate the very shadows and edges that provide depth and direction. The ability to sense beyond the light—to know there's more without seeing it all—is feature not bug.

"I've been trying to build stadium lights when I needed a good torch."

This final insight captures his entire journey. The mismatch wasn't between his capabilities and requirements but between his capabilities and his assumptions about requirements. He doesn't need to illuminate everything, just navigate successfully.

The humor in this recognition—trying to build stadium lights for cave exploration—shows healthy perspective on his previous ambitions. He can laugh at the unnecessary complexity he was attempting while appreciating the elegant sufficiency of what he has.

The visual elements emphasize practical functionality over grand illumination. The modest but sufficient beam shows light doesn't need to be total to be effective. The clear path through darkness demonstrates that navigation requires only enough visibility for the next few steps.

The contrast between small light and effective movement captures the essence of sufficiency. The goal isn't maximum illumination but successful passage. A small, steady light that moves with you beats fixed floodlights every time.

This scene completes a crucial therapeutic arc. Evan moves from feeling inadequate about his limits to recognizing them as perfectly calibrated for human life. Two levels of recursion and three moves of anticipation aren't limitations—they're specifications for an instrument designed for exactly the kind of navigation humans need to do.

The philosophical insight—that wisdom lies in recognizing sufficiency—challenges cultural messages about always needing more. More light, more insight, more capability. But Evan discovers that his flashlight-sized consciousness is exactly right for the human-sized caves he actually needs to navigate.

In this practical wisdom space, enlightenment looks less like cosmic illumination and more like having exactly the right tool for the job at hand. Evan's 2x3 flashlight isn't a failed stadium light but a successful torch. And in the caves of human experience, a good torch is all you need—bright enough to avoid walls, modest enough to preserve mystery, sized perfectly for the journey of being human.
