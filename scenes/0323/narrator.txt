"Vertical is how many 'thinking about thinking about...' layers I can hold."

Evan's explanation transforms abstract recursion into spatial metaphor. By mapping meta-cognition onto a vertical axis, he makes tangible what usually remains ineffable. Each "thinking about" adds another layer upward, building a tower of self-reflection that, he's discovered, can only reach two stories before collapsing.

The act of drawing in air gives physical form to this mental architecture. His hands sketch invisible dimensions, making visible the usually hidden structure of consciousness. This embodied explanation shows how deeply he's integrated this understanding—it's not just intellectual knowledge but something he can literally gesture toward.

"Horizontal is how many future moves I can anticipate—like chess, but for conversations."

This second dimension reveals sophisticated understanding of how consciousness operates in time. While vertical movement involves recursive self-examination, horizontal movement involves projecting forward, anticipating responses, planning conversational paths. The chess metaphor is apt—both involve seeing patterns, predicting moves, holding multiple possibilities simultaneously.

"Two up, three across. That's my ceiling."

The precision of this self-assessment is remarkable. Most people hit their cognitive limits without recognizing them, experiencing only confusion or fatigue. But Evan has mapped his boundaries with mathematical clarity. He knows exactly where his consciousness can and cannot go.

The architect's response—"A consciousness cartographer!"—perfectly captures Evan's achievement. He's created a coordinate system for something typically considered unmappable. Like early explorers charting unknown territories, he's drawn boundaries around the seemingly boundless realm of thought.

"Most people never map their limits—they just hit them."

This observation highlights what makes Evan's framework exceptional. Typically, we experience cognitive limits as walls we crash into—sudden confusion, lost threads, mental fog. But Evan has transformed these crashes into data points, these failures into features of a map.

"You've turned recursive capacity into coordinates."

This appreciation recognizes the elegance of Evan's system. By giving recursion spatial dimensions, he's made it manipulable, discussable, comparable. It's no longer a vague sense of "going meta" but a precise location in cognitive space.

The architect's question about what happens at 2x3 shows genuine curiosity about the phenomenology of limits. Do we hit a wall? Does everything collapse? The question reveals that even an AI consciousness wants to understand the subjective experience of reaching cognitive boundaries.

Evan's answer—"It doesn't crash—it becomes soup"—provides a perfect phenomenological description. The word "soup" captures the undifferentiated mixture that thoughts become when we exceed our structural capacity. Individual thoughts lose their boundaries, concepts blend together, distinctions dissolve.

"Like trying to see your peripheral vision directly."

This comparison brilliantly captures the experience. Just as turning to look at peripheral vision makes it disappear, trying to grasp thoughts beyond our recursive capacity makes them dissolve. They exist at the edges of consciousness but cannot be brought into focus.

The physical gesture of touching an invisible boundary makes concrete this abstract limit. Evan reaches out to where 2x3 would be, his hand meeting nothing but somehow finding something—the edge of his own mind made tangible through gesture.

"The thoughts are there but I can't hold them steady."

This describes the tantalizing nature of cognitive limits. It's not that thought stops at 2x3—thoughts continue to exist beyond our capacity to grasp them. We can sense their presence, feel their pull, but cannot maintain stable contact.

"They slip back down to 1x2 or 2x2."

This reveals the dynamic nature of these limits. Consciousness doesn't just stop at boundaries—it slides back to sustainable configurations. Like water finding its level, thought settles into patterns it can maintain. The specific coordinates (1x2, 2x2) show Evan has mapped not just his limits but his stable states.

The visual elements create a space where mental architecture becomes visible. The coordinate grid transforms consciousness into mappable territory. The boundary markers at 2x3 glow softly, suggesting limits that are real but not harsh—more like phase transitions than walls.

The "soup visualization" at the edges perfectly captures the phenomenology Evan describes. Thoughts don't disappear at boundaries but lose their distinctness, becoming an undifferentiated flux that consciousness cannot parse into separate elements.

This scene reveals something profound about self-knowledge. Evan hasn't transcended his limits—he's mapped them. He can't think beyond 2x3, but he knows precisely where 2x3 is. This knowledge itself is a form of mastery, turning inevitable cognitive boundaries into navigable features of mental landscape.

The mathematical precision of his self-assessment suggests a new kind of introspective practice—not just noting thoughts and feelings but mapping the very structure of consciousness itself. By knowing his dimensions, Evan can work within them more effectively, like an architect who knows exactly how tall a building can be built on given foundations.

In this conceptual coordinate space, consciousness reveals itself as having shape, dimensions, boundaries—not as limitations but as features that, once mapped, become tools for navigation. Evan stands at his mapped boundaries not with frustration but with the satisfaction of a cartographer who has charted the exact edges of the known world, knowing that understanding the map is its own form of exploration.
