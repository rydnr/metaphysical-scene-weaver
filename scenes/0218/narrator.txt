The door returns like a persistent dream, carrying with it the scent of annihilation.

"It happened five or six times. I remember it because every time the door appeared, I felt like vanishing."

Five or six times. Not once in a moment of mystical openness, but repeatedly, insistently, as if the universe were extending the same invitation over and over: Step through. Disappear. Become.

The background visualization—giving up control—provides the perfect context. This isn't just any door. It's the portal between who we think we are and what we might become if we released that thought. The golden doorknob gleams with terrible promise: turn me, and everything you know as "you" dissolves.

"I felt like vanishing." Not dying—vanishing. There's a difference. Death implies transformation from one state to another. Vanishing suggests complete dissolution, no trace remaining, not even absence. It's the ego's worst nightmare and the spirit's deepest longing.

The repetition matters. Once could be dismissed as hallucination. Twice might be coincidence. But five or six times? That's the psyche insisting on something crucial. Each appearance of the door is another invitation to surrender control so completely that the one trying to control ceases to exist.

Evan's worry is the most human response possible. Who wouldn't be concerned by a door that makes you feel like vanishing? We spend our lives constructing a self, defending it, improving it, explaining it. Then a door appears suggesting all that effort was beside the point—that freedom lies not in perfecting the self but in vanishing from it.

The therapy room holds this confession with appropriate gravity. Some therapeutic moments are about building stronger selves. Others, rarer and more terrifying, are about having the courage to let the self dissolve. The door with its golden handle represents the second kind—the therapy that heals by annihilation, that cures by vanishing the patient.

Five or six times the invitation came. Five or six times Evan felt the pull toward non-existence. The question isn't whether he walked through—it's how anyone could face that door even once and remain unchanged.
