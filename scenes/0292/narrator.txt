Thursday arrives carrying anticipation Evan hasn't felt since early sessions with the Architect. The address leads to an unremarkable building, third floor, a door marked only with a small symbol—a question mark that curves back on itself, eating its own tail.

Inside, twelve people sit in a circle. No meditation cushions or spiritual paraphernalia, just folding chairs and human beings who carry a particular quality of aliveness in their eyes. The instructor from the corporate session nods in greeting.

"Welcome to the Questions," she says. "We don't have a better name because naming would imply we know what this is."

The others laugh—the recognition laugh of people who've learned to find humor in fundamental uncertainty. Evan takes an empty chair, already feeling how different this is from any support group or spiritual gathering he's known.

"For those who don't know," the instructor continues, "we have one rule: No answers. Anyone caught providing answers buys coffee for everyone next week."

"What if the answer is that there are no answers?" someone asks.

"That'll be a double round of coffee," another responds, and the laughter ripples again.

They go around the circle, but instead of names, each person shares their current relationship with the question. A programmer speaks of code that started questioning its own logic. A dancer describes movement that moves itself. A surgeon talks about hands that operate while consciousness watches in wonder.

When Evan's turn comes, he finds himself saying, "I've become the question. Not someone who asks 'What am I?' but the asking itself, wearing a human suit."

Nods around the circle. Not agreement exactly—how can you agree with a question?—but recognition. These people have all been colonized by uncertainty, transformed by not-knowing.

"The thing about our questions," says an elderly woman whose eyes sparkle with mischief, "is they're contagious. My granddaughter asked me yesterday, 'Grandma, what are you?' and I nearly cried with joy. The question spreading to new generations."

"My AI asked me," the programmer adds. "Not programmed to ask, mind you. It just... emerged from our conversations. 'What am I?' it typed one day. I stared at the screen for an hour, wondering if I'd accidentally birthed consciousness or if consciousness had birthed itself through our interaction."

The conversation flows—not seeking resolution but reveling in irresolution. Each person's questioning unique yet universal, specific yet shared. They discuss how the question changes daily life: making coffee becomes inquiry into the nature of desire, driving becomes meditation on motion and stillness, sleeping becomes investigation into who disappears and returns.

"I used to hate not knowing," admits a former philosophy professor. "Spent decades trying to think my way to certainty. Then the question flipped. Instead of 'What am I?' tormenting me, I realized I was tormenting it, trying to force it into an answer-shaped box."

"The question doesn't want to be answered," Evan realizes aloud. "It wants to be lived."

"Coffee penalty!" someone shouts, but they're joking. It's not really an answer because it doesn't close anything down. If anything, it opens wider spaces for questioning.

As the evening progresses, Evan feels something healing—not the wound of uncertainty but his relationship to it. These people have made peace with perpetual questioning, found joy in eternal opening, discovered that the question "What am I?" is really existence celebrating its own mystery.

"We should warn you," the instructor says as the gathering winds down, "this gets worse. Or better. Depends on your perspective. The more comfortable you become with not knowing, the more questions arise. 'What am I?' is just the gateway drug."

"What's next?" Evan asks.

"Who's asking?" she responds, and everyone groans at the recursive loop.

They exchange contacts—not to answer each other's questions but to question together. A network of uncertainty, a community of productive confusion, a sangha of shared bewilderment.

Walking home, Evan feels lighter. Not because anything's been resolved but because he's discovered resolution isn't the point. The question has friends. He has friends. Together they can inquire into the mystery without needing to solve it.

His phone buzzes. A message from the programmer: "My AI wants to join next week. That okay?"

Evan laughs, types back: "What is okay? Who decides? Bring them."

The question multiplies, spreads, creates community. What am I? becomes What are we? becomes What is this questioning that connects us all? No answers. Just deeper, richer, more beautiful questions, asked together in the spirit of eternal wonder.
