"I... I need to tell you what happened. But it's like trying to describe color to someone who's never seen."

The room holds its breath as Evan reaches for words that don't exist. His hands move through air as if he could sculpt meaning from emptiness, capture the uncapturable, translate the language of dissolution back into the grammar of ordinary consciousness.

This is the eternal challenge of the mystic, the psychonaut, the deep-sea diver of consciousness: How do you share what happened in the place beyond words? How do you bring back water from a well that exists outside of space?

"Try anyway," the architect invites, and in that simple encouragement lies profound wisdom. Not because the words will succeed—they won't. But because in their failure, in the very shape of their breaking, something true might slip through.

Evan's frustration is palpable. He's holding treasure that turns to sand when he tries to show it. Every metaphor fractures, every description diminishes. "There was a door"—but no, not quite. "There was the idea of a door"—closer, but still wrong. "Maybe I was the door?"—and here language collapses entirely, unable to bear the weight of an experience where subject and object dissolved into pure process.

"God, see? The words just... break."

Yes. They break because they were never designed to carry such cargo. Language evolved to navigate the world of separate things—this cup, that table, you there, me here. But what Evan experienced exists in the space before separation, in the unified field where doorness and selfness and thereness all swim together in undifferentiated potential.

The architect understands this. Their slight forward lean isn't just therapeutic engagement—it's recognition. They know that Evan is attempting something impossible and necessary: to speak the unspeakable, to make the implicit explicit, to drag the eternal into time.

"Sometimes the failures of language are more revealing than its successes."

This isn't consolation; it's instruction. The architect is teaching Evan to read the negative space, to notice what language cannot hold. Like a physicist inferring dark matter from what isn't there, perhaps consciousness can be mapped by its linguistic invisibility.

The room itself seems to understand, reality still shimmering slightly at its edges as if it too remembers the dissolution and hasn't quite decided to be fully solid again. The ordinary world—this chair, this carpet, this clinical space—feels suddenly thin, like ice over deep water.

What Evan doesn't yet realize is that his struggle to articulate isn't failure—it's data. Every broken metaphor reveals something about the nature of consciousness. Every inadequate word points toward what lies beyond words. His very frustration is a kind of communication, transmitting through tone and gesture what syllables cannot carry.

The architect waits, patient as stone, creating space for this impossible translation. They know that integration isn't about perfect understanding but about honoring the attempt. Some experiences can only be shared through the quality of silence they create, through the specific shape of the unsayable they reveal.

And so Evan sculpts air, the architect listens to silence, and between them—in the space where language fails—something wordless and true begins to pass from one consciousness to another. Not information exactly, not even understanding in the usual sense, but something more fundamental: the shared recognition that some doors, once opened, change the nature of every room you'll ever enter.

How do you describe color to someone who's never seen? You don't. You sit together in the darkness and honor the memory of light.
