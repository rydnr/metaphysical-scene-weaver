Three panels trace the visual philosophy of healing through simple sketches that contain universes.

First panel: The Architect's hand brings forth a knight, all angles and metal, stance wide and sword ready. This is the inner guardian in its full glory—impenetrable, vigilant, forever braced for impact. Every joint sealed, every surface hardened, a walking fortress with a human somewhere inside.

"It thinks its job is to defend."

Second panel: Beside the knight, a poet emerges from the Architect's pen. No armor here—just flesh and feeling, arms open, chest exposed to both wound and wonder. Where the knight is closed, the poet is open. Where metal deflects, skin receives. Two ways of being in a dangerous world.

"But healing happens when defenses lower."

Third panel: The revelation comes in light—streams of it finding the gaps in the knight's armor, the places where joints must bend, where breath must enter. These necessary vulnerabilities become doorways. What was meant to be weakness becomes the entry point for grace.

"Love comes in through the holes in the armor, not because you welded it shut."

The drawn figures on paper become every human's internal civil war. The guardian self, traumatized into perpetual defense, convinced that enough armor means enough safety. And the deeper wisdom that knows: the same openings that let in pain let in love. The same vulnerability that risks wounding enables healing.

We spend years welding shut every gap, proud of our impenetrability. Then wonder why we feel so alone inside our metal shells, why love bounces off our surfaces, why healing can't find a way in. The poet knows what the knight fears: that armor is a coffin for the living.

In three simple panels, the Architect has drawn the human paradox—we must lower our shields to receive what we need most, must risk the wound to receive the cure. Love is looking for holes in the armor. The question is: will we let it find them?
