  "scene_notes": "Evan discovers the cosmic humor in their entire endeavor. After all the serious questioning, he realizes the whole thing might be an elaborate joke—consciousness pranking itself by pretending not to know what it is. The Architect joins in the laughter, recognizing they haven't been solving a problem but slowly getting a joke. The scene suggests enlightenment might simply be the moment when you finally laugh at the beautiful absurdity of existence."
