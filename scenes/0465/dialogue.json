Other days it pulls back, lets me walk the exposed floor of myself. *deep breath with ocean* Both are necessary. High tide brings new questions, low tide reveals what's been there all along. *peaceful certainty* The lighthouse doesn't answer the waves—it just keeps shining through all their asking.",
