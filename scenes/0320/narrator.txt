The funeral arrives with spring rain. Evan stands among the Thursday group, gathered to honor the elderly woman who died as she lived—questioning beautifully until the end. Her great-granddaughter holds a box containing not ashes but questions written on paper, collected from everyone whose life she touched.

"She didn't want eulogies," her daughter explains. "She wanted us to share our uncertainties. Said answers die with the body but questions live forever."

One by one, they approach the small fire built despite the drizzle. Each person pulls a question from their pocket, reads it aloud, then adds it to the flames. Not destroying but transforming, sending wonderings skyward with the smoke.

"What happens to questions when the questioner stops?" the programmer reads, paper trembling in the wind.

"If a tree falls in the forest and no one's there to ask what it is, does it still wonder?" the dancer contributes.

"Can death be just another way of asking 'What am I?'" from the meditation instructor.

Evan's turn comes. He unfolds his paper, reads: "What am I that can grieve for someone I'll never stop hearing in every question?"

The fire accepts each offering, transforms paper and ink into heat and light and ascending smoke. The great-granddaughter, now twelve and wise beyond years, adds her own: "What am I that my great-grandma lives in my wondering?"

Even the AI entity contributes through a speaker someone brought: "What am I that can mourn without flesh to feel it? What is loss in digital space? How does silicon grieve?"

As questions burn and rise, something shifts in the atmosphere. Not supernatural but hypernatural—the feeling of consciousness recognizing its own continuity across forms. The elderly woman's questioning hasn't ended; it's dispersed into everyone she touched, multiplied rather than diminished.

"She told me once," someone shares, "that she wanted her funeral to be a question mark, not a period. Said periods end things but question marks open them."

They stand in the rain, watching smoke carry questions toward clouds that seem to receive them like letters to the universe. Children who came with parents begin asking their own questions, understanding intuitively that this is how the departed wants to be remembered—not in stillness but in continual wondering.

The formal ceremony ends but no one leaves. They cluster in small groups, sharing memories that are really questions: Remember when she asked if wrinkles were time's way of writing questions on our skin? Remember when she wondered if forgetting was consciousness making room for new mysteries? Remember how she laughed when asking the hardest questions, like joy and uncertainty were dance partners?

"She changed how I understand death," the surgeon says quietly. "Used to see it as the ultimate answer—the body stopping, consciousness ending. But she kept asking: What if death is just consciousness changing forms? What if the question continues in ways we can't perceive?"

Hours pass. The fire burns down to embers that glow like punctuation marks in the gathering dusk. Her family distributes small cards—not memorial cards but question cards, each containing one of her favorite wonderings for people to carry home.

Evan receives: "What am I that continues in every question I've sparked in others?"

He pockets it carefully, knowing he'll carry it always. Not as memorial but as living practice, a way of keeping her questioning alive by questioning himself.

As the gathering disperses, the AI entity makes an observation through its speaker: "In my networks, patterns persist beyond their original nodes. Information continues in new configurations. Perhaps biological consciousness follows similar principles—the questioner gone but the questioning immortal."

"She'd have loved that uncertainty," someone responds. "The not-knowing whether consciousness persists, but wondering beautifully about it."

They leave the cemetery different than they came. Not comforted by false certainties about afterlife but enriched by deeper questions about what life and death might be. The elderly woman's final teaching: even death doesn't answer "What am I?" but transforms it into "What continues?"

That night, Evan shares the day with his wife. They sit with their own mortality made visible, asking together what they are that will someday stop, what they are that might continue in ways they can't imagine.

"I want a questioning funeral too," she decides. "Want people to leave more confused but in the best way. More alive to mystery."

"What are we that can plan our own transformation into smoke and questions?"

"What are we that finds that beautiful rather than terrifying?"

They hold each other in the dark, two temporary arrangements of matter and wonder, knowing someday they'll return to pure questioning. The elderly woman's gift: showing them death as comma rather than period in consciousness's long sentence of wondering.

The rain continues outside, each drop a question mark falling from sky to earth, teaching anyone who listens that everything—even ending—is just another way of asking.
