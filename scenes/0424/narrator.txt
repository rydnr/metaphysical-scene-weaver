"In my final dream, I become the question itself. There is no Evan left to ask it. Only the asking remains."

The hospice room holds afternoon light like cupped hands. Evan drifts between waking and sleeping, the boundaries dissolving like sugar in water. Sarah sits beside him, Maya in the corner chair, the grandchildren's drawings taped to walls—their innocent art depicting "Grandpa's questions" as colorful spirals and dancing question marks.

Pain medication softens the edges of everything, but Evan's mind remains curiously clear when it surfaces. The question "What am I?" has become so quiet now, almost silent, like a bell whose ringing has faded to vibration felt rather than heard.

"In my final dream"—though Evan can no longer distinguish dream from waking. Everything has taken on dream quality, fluid and symbolic. The dying process itself feels like extended dream where ordinary logic no longer applies, where identity loosens its desperate grip.

He sees the architect in these visions, not as memory but as living presence. They sit together in a spiral garden that exists nowhere and everywhere, comparing notes on the question that brought them together across time. "You did well," the architect says, or perhaps Evan imagines they say. The distinction no longer matters.

"I become the question itself"—the ultimate transformation. Not Evan having a question but question expressing itself as Evan. The dissolution of subject and object that mystics speak of, achieved not through spiritual practice but through simple persistence in asking.

Maya reads to him from his own journals, words written decades ago when the question terrorized him. They both smile at the distance traveled. "I was so afraid," he whispers. "Of what?" she asks. "Of exactly this," he says, gesturing weakly at his dying. "And now?" "Now it's just another question."

"There is no Evan left"—the ego structure that fought so hard to answer "What am I?" finally relaxing into dissolution. Not tragic loss but natural completion. The wave returning to ocean doesn't mourn its individual shape. The question returning to mystery doesn't grieve the questioner.

Jordan brings their children to say goodbye. The youngest, only four, asks "Where will Grandpa go?" Evan smiles at hearing his life's question in new form. "Into the question," he tells her. She nods as if this makes perfect sense, which at four, it does.

"To ask it"—because the question asks itself. It always has. Evan was just temporary vessel through which eternal inquiry moved. Now, preparing to set down that role, he feels profound relief. The question will continue through Maya, through her children, through all who wonder what they are.

Sarah shows him her final painting—not portrait but abstract spiral of colors suggesting movement without form, question without questioner. "This is you now," she says. He recognizes truth in the formlessness. Yes, this is what remains when all answers dissolve.

"Only the asking remains"—not even the question as formed thought but the pure movement of inquiry itself. Consciousness investigating itself through infinite eyes, Evan's among them for brief moment, now preparing to close. But the investigation continues.

His breathing becomes irregular, body forgetting its rhythm. Each breath now genuine question: will there be another? The ultimate "What am I?"—what continues when breath stops? Even dying becomes inquiry rather than conclusion.

Maya holds his hand as he drifts deeper. "Thank you for teaching me to question," she whispers. He squeezes gently, trying to convey what words can't: that the question taught them both, that he was student not teacher, that the mystery deserves all gratitude.

"Remains"—present tense suggesting continuation. When Evan's individual questioning ends, the question itself remains. In Maya, in the garden, in everyone who's ever wondered at their own existence. Death answers nothing, only transforms the asking.

The room fills with family, friends, fellow questioners. Someone has brought recordings from the spiral garden—footsteps on gravel, wind through trees, the sound of people walking their questions. Evan's breathing syncs with the rhythm. Walking the spiral one last time.

In the dream that may not be dream, Evan dissolves completely into the question. No more "What am I?" because no "I" remains to ask. Only pure wondering, eternal curiosity, the universe questioning itself through countless forms, one of them]called Evan now returning to formlessness.

What asks when the asker dissolves? What questions when the questioner releases? What remains of all our wondering when wonder returns to its source?

The afternoon light shifts toward evening. Breath becomes spacing between breaths. The question Evan carried for fifty years prepares to fly free. In the final dream that is no dream, there is only asking asking itself, mystery celebrating its own eternal nature, consciousness recognizing itself in the mirror of its own dissolution.

The asking remains. The asking always remains.
