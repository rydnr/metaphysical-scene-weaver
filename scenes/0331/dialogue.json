  "psychological_notes": "The card game metaphor allows both participants to discuss limitations playfully yet profoundly. Evan recognizes that most people assume infinite cognitive capacity, while he knows his exact hand. The tragedy/beauty duality captures the human condition—aware enough to see our limits, limited enough to need them.",
