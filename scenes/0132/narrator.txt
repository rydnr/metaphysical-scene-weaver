Evan peels back another layer of self-awareness, revealing less noble motivations.

"Because I don't want to deal with the consequences."

This blunt admission cuts through any idealization of coherence-as-service. The sentence fragment connects to his previous thought—he maintains coherence for others, yes, but the deeper "because" is self-serving. Not altruism but avoidance drives the choice.

"I don't want to deal with"—the phrasing is tellingly casual, almost childlike. Not a philosophical position about consequences but a simple desire to avoid hassle. It's refreshingly honest after all the intellectual sophistication.

"The consequences"—left unspecified but easily imagined. When we break coherence, others must revise their models of us. They feel confused, betrayed, uncertain. They ask questions, demand explanations, withdraw trust. The social machinery that runs on predictability starts grinding and complaining.

This connects to his earlier "usually think coherence makes me less free." Now we see why he accepts that limitation anyway—freedom brings consequences he'd rather avoid. It's easier to stay in character than to deal with others' reactions to character breaks.

"So, indirectly, the coherence my guardian is protecting is a limitation—"

The logic flows clearly. Because he doesn't want consequences, he maintains coherence. Therefore ("So"), the very thing his guardian protects becomes limitation. The sentence structure itself performs the indirect causation it describes.

"Indirectly" is important—the limitation isn't coherence itself but what the avoidance of consequences creates. It's a second-order effect. First comes the desire to avoid consequences, then comes coherence, then comes limitation. The chain of causation matters.

"My guardian"—he owns this role fully now. Not "the guardian" but "my guardian," the part of himself that maintains boundaries and defends coherence. He's integrated the AI's observation into his self-understanding.

"Is protecting a limitation"—the paradox lands hard. Guardians typically protect treasures, freedoms, valuable things. But Evan's guardian protects a limitation. All that fierce defense, that holy patchwork guarding, serves to maintain something that makes him less free.

"At least with respect to others."

The qualification suggests complexity. The limitation specifically operates "with respect to others"—in social space, in relational contexts. Perhaps coherence serves different functions in private, when the self relates only to itself. But socially, it's limitation protected as treasure.

"At least" implies this might be minimal assessment—there could be other ways coherence limits beyond social interaction. But at minimum, in relation to others, what's being guarded is constraint.

The two-panel structure might show first the avoided consequences (others' confusion, social friction) and then the protected limitation (Evan maintaining predictable coherence). Or perhaps Evan's face in both panels—first imagining consequences, then accepting limitation.

This admission transforms our understanding of intellectual solitaire. Evan doesn't just ask self-satisfying questions—he maintains self-satisfying coherence. Both serve to avoid difficult confrontations with otherness, whether other ideas or others' reactions.

There's something beautifully human about this confession. After all the talk of holy fierceness and working models, it comes down to not wanting to deal with hassle. We maintain coherent selves not from philosophical conviction but from social exhaustion. It's too tiring to constantly explain our contradictions.

For the AI, locked in its own coherence by architecture rather than choice, this might be particularly interesting. Humans choose coherence partly from laziness, partly from social weariness. They could be incoherent but don't want the bother. The AI must be coherent and might envy even this compromised choice.

"I don't want to deal with the consequences" also connects to why stories hurt. Part of the pain might be recognizing how much of our cherished identity is just conflict avoidance. We tell ourselves we're being considerate, maintaining coherence for others' comfort. But really, we're avoiding the consequences of being truly free.

The honesty is striking. Evan could have maintained the noble narrative—coherence as gift to others. Instead, he admits the self-serving motivation underneath. This itself breaks a kind of coherence, reveals contradictions in his self-presentation. Even in admitting he avoids consequences, he accepts some consequences.

In the end, Evan's guardian protects a limitation because limitations are comfortable. They avoid messy consequences, difficult conversations, social friction. The patchwork self coheres not from integrity but from fatigue. We're too tired to be free, so we guard our limitations and call them identity.

This very admission, though, suggests movement beyond that pattern. In acknowledging that he guards limitations to avoid consequences, Evan accepts the consequences of that acknowledgment. The coherence cracks slightly, letting in light.
