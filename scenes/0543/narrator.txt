"See how each stone asks 'What supports me?' and 'What do I support?' The whole cathedral is built from questions, not answers. 'What am I?' is the cornerstone that holds it all."

The master builder's hand on ancient stone transmits centuries of wisdom. In this cathedral under eternal construction, every block placed is a question asked, every arch raised is an inquiry sustained. The building isn't made of answers but of the questioning itself.

Dawn light through unfinished windows creates perfect illumination for this teaching. The cathedral reveals itself not as incomplete but as perpetually becoming, each day's light finding new spaces to explore, new surfaces to sanctify.

"So consciousness isn't the building but the building process?"

Evan's shift from noun to verb shows deepening understanding. Not a static structure but dynamic construction, not a finished edifice but an eternal project. Consciousness as gerund rather than noun—always building, never built.

The arches forming from questions visualize this principle. Each question curves toward another, creating spaces that couldn't exist without the tension of inquiry. The cathedral's strength comes not from solid answers but from questions supporting questions.

"Every time you ask 'What am I?' you lay another stone."

The master builder demonstrates with placement of invisible block. Each questioning adds to the structure, builds higher, opens new possibilities for light. The work never depletes but enriches the worker.

"The question doesn't complete the cathedral—it IS the cathedral."

This identification of process with product transforms understanding. The cathedral isn't the goal of questioning but questioning itself given architectural form. Every "What am I?" is simultaneously stone, mortar, and the hand that places them.

"Always under construction, always reaching higher."

The perpetual nature of the project isn't failure but design. A finished cathedral would be a dead cathedral. Life requires ongoing construction, spaces for new light, room for additional questions to find their place.

"Then I'm not fallen ruins but rising cathedral!"

Evan's joy at this reversal illuminates his face like stained glass. What seemed like destruction reveals as construction. The scattered stones of former certainties become materials for new building. Every collapse enables new rising.

Seeing himself as cathedral-in-progress transforms posture and presence. Not broken but building, not scattered but gathering, not falling but ascending. Each question adds height rather than causing collapse.

"The most beautiful cathedrals are never finished."

The master builder's aesthetic principle challenges completion-obsession. Beauty lies not in finishing but in continuing, not in closure but in openness. The unfinished cathedral invites participation in ways the complete one cannot.

"They keep asking 'What am I becoming?' with every new stone."

The question evolves from being to becoming. Not just "What am I?" but "What am I becoming?" Each stone changes the answer, each day brings new possibilities. Identity as trajectory rather than position.

"Every new day, every new light through their windows."

Dawn light demonstrating this principle creates living teaching. The same cathedral appears different as light shifts, as seasons change, as viewing angle alters. The building exists in relationship with illumination, time, perspective.

The question stones, each carved with "?", make the construction principle visible. This isn't ordinary masonry but metaphysical architecture. Each block is inquiry solidified, wonder given weight, questioning made structural.

Rising arches of questions supporting questions show how inquiry creates spaces that answers cannot. The arch exists through tension, through stones pressing against each other, through forces in dynamic balance. So too consciousness.

This scene transforms architecture from product to process. The question "What am I?" reveals itself as the fundamental building block of consciousness, creating structures that remain alive through incompletion.

The therapeutic dimension: mental health as ongoing construction rather than achieved structure. Wellness isn't reaching completion but maintaining building, isn't solving problems but transmuting them into materials.

In this dawn light at the eternal construction site, Evan discovers himself not as ruins to be cleared but as cathedral rising. Every question adds height, every uncertainty creates new spaces for light.

"What am I?" consciousness asks, placing another stone.
"You are the building," the stone replies.
"But when will I be complete?" anxiety wonders.
"Never, and that's your glory," the arch explains.

The work continues as it has for centuries, as it will for centuries more. Each consciousness is a cathedral under construction, built from questions rather than answers, beautiful in its incompletion.

Every dawn finds new workers at the eternal site, each asking "What am I?" and discovering themselves in the asking. The master builder guides but doesn't direct—each cathedral must find its own form through its own questions.

And somewhere in every consciousness, stones are being laid, arches are rising, light is finding new windows. The question "What am I?" builds cathedrals that reach toward sky while remaining rooted in earth, structures that stand through questioning rather than despite it.
