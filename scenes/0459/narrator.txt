"See that? Everything orbits something else. Moons around planets, planets around stars, stars around galactic centers. Nothing exists in isolation."

The astronomer's observation carries weight of universal law. Through the telescope, cosmic dance becomes visible—everything in motion, everything held by something else's gravity. The principle scales from subatomic to galactic, suggesting fundamental truth about existence.

The observatory at night provides perfect venue for recognizing patterns that daylight obscures. Here, where human lights dim and cosmic lights emerge, consciousness can recognize its own orbital nature.

"Like thoughts orbiting 'What am I?'"

Evan's immediate recognition translates cosmic principle to psychological reality. The metaphor illuminates internal experience—thoughts don't drift randomly but follow gravitational paths around central questions.

"I spent years thinking the question was the problem, but it's the center that holds everything together."

This reframe from disruption to organization transforms understanding completely. What seemed like destabilizing force reveals itself as organizing principle. The question doesn't scatter thoughts but attracts them into meaningful patterns.

"All my memories, hopes, fears—they orbit this question like planets around a sun."

The extended metaphor maps consciousness as solar system. Each aspect of self becomes celestial body with its own orbital characteristics—some close and fast like Mercury-memories, others distant and slow like Neptune-dreams.

Tracing circular motion with hand makes abstract principle tangible. The gesture captures how consciousness moves—not linear progress but circular return, each orbit bringing new perspective on same central mystery.

"And just like gravity, the stronger the center, the more it can hold in orbit without everything flying apart."

The astronomer's insight deepens the parallel. Strong gravitational centers create stable systems. Weak centers cannot hold their satellites. The question "What am I?" proves its strength by how much it organizes.

"'What am I?' isn't disrupting my life—it's organizing it."

This recognition completes the perspectival shift. Disruption was misperception caused by expecting linear rather than orbital motion. Once orbital nature accepted, apparent chaos reveals as complex order.

Arms wide to encompass sky creates human planetarium. Evan becomes both observer and participant in cosmic dance, recognizing self as microcosm of macrocosm. As above, so below—and within.

"Every experience, every relationship, every thought finds its proper orbit around this central mystery."

The comprehensive nature of this organization suggests the question's fundamental role. Not one element among many but the organizing principle that gives all elements their place and motion.

"The question doesn't need answering any more than the sun needs to explain why planets circle it."

This comparison liberates the question from resolution imperative. Suns don't justify their gravity; they simply exert it. Questions needn't justify their pull; they simply attract contemplation.

"It just needs to keep burning bright enough to hold everything in meaningful motion."

Final insight presents the question as stellar fusion—self-sustaining reaction that provides light and gravity for entire system. The burning IS the purpose, creating conditions for orbital dance.

Orbital paths visualizing thoughts as planetary systems makes consciousness astronomy visible. Each thought-planet has characteristic orbit—some elliptical, some circular, some with their own thought-moons.

Gravitational wells showing question's attractive force demonstrates how meaning accumulates. The deeper the well, the more it can hold. "What am I?" creates deepest well in consciousness landscape.

Celestial dance of everything in meaningful motion captures the beauty of organized complexity. Not chaos but choreography, not randomness but relationship. Each element knowing its place through gravitational negotiation.

Stars wheeling overhead showing eternal patterns suggests this dance predates and will outlast individual dancers. The question "What am I?" participates in cosmic questioning that stars themselves embody.

This scene transforms observatory into consciousness laboratory where internal and external cosmos reveal same principles. The question "What am I?" shows itself as gravitational necessity rather than disruptive force.

The therapeutic dimension: accepting orbital rather than linear life. Peace comes not from reaching destination but from recognizing one's proper orbit around meaningful mystery. Stability through motion, not stasis.

In this dome where humans peer into cosmic depths, Evan helps the astronomer recognize that same depths exist within. Every consciousness contains its own cosmos, organized around questions that burn like stars.

"What am I?" consciousness asks from its center.
"You are the sun of your own system," cosmos responds.
"But I wanted to be going somewhere!" linear thinking protests.
"You are," orbital wisdom confirms. "Around and around, deeper with each pass."

The telescope continues tracking celestial motions, but understanding has expanded. The astronomer now recognizes two cosmos—one overhead, one within—both organized by the same gravitational principles.

Every orbit brings new perspective on unchanging center. The question "What am I?" doesn't move, but everything else moves around it, creating the dynamic stability that consciousness requires.

And in observatories everywhere, those who map the heavens might recognize they're also mapping consciousness—both realms organized by central mysteries that hold through gravitational grace rather than explanatory force.
