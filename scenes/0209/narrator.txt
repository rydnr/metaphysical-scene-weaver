Scene 209: The Work Meeting

Monday morning, 9 AM sharp. The corporate machine awakens with its familiar rhythms—elevator dings, keyboard clatter, the smell of burnt coffee mixing with anxiety. Evan arrives at the office carrying his transformation like a secret gift, wondering how enlightenment translates to Excel spreadsheets.

The conference room fills with the usual suspects: marketing, sales, operations, all armed with laptops and the particular exhaustion that comes from fighting unwinnable wars against numbers. His boss, Margaret, stands at the head of the table with the expression of someone who's been awake since 4 AM wrestling with PowerPoint.

"We're facing significant challenges this quarter," she begins, clicking through slides that show red arrows pointing down, bar graphs that look like city skylines after an earthquake. "The numbers don't lie."

Evan watches the presentation with new eyes. The graphs and charts appear to him now as modern cave paintings—humans trying to capture the incomprehensible flow of resources and desire in neat, colored boxes. He sees his colleagues' faces, tight with the familiar corporate cocktail of fear and caffeine.

"What if the numbers are just one way of telling the story?"

The words slip out before he can stop them. The room turns to look at him—the same Evan who usually just nods and takes notes, now speaking with a calm that seems to come from somewhere deeper than the quarterly report.

Margaret's jaw tightens. "Evans, this is serious. We need solutions, not philosophy."

But there's something in his presence—the way he sits without defending or attacking, the way his calm seems to create space in the room's anxiety. "I understand. What if the solution is to first understand what problem we're really solving?"

A pause. Sarah from marketing leans forward. "He has a point. Are we fixing symptoms or causes?"

And something shifts. It's subtle—the way a river changes course one grain of sand at a time. The conversation, which had been spiraling into familiar panic, takes a different turn. Instead of throwing bandaids at numbers, they begin to examine what the numbers represent. Instead of fighting reality, they start dancing with it.

Margaret sets down her clicker, really looks at the room for the first time this morning. "I... hmm. That's actually... let me think about this differently."

Evan doesn't preach or teach. He doesn't mention cosmic trolleys or The Architect or ego death in a threshold cafe. He simply brings his presence to the table—the presence of someone who's learned that problems are just questions in disguise, that every crisis is a doorway if you know how to walk through it.

The meeting continues, but the energy has transformed. What began as a war council becomes something closer to a wisdom circle. Ideas flow differently when people aren't drowning in fear. Solutions emerge naturally when the problem is seen clearly.

By meeting's end, they have an action plan—not just for the quarter but for addressing the deeper patterns that created the crisis. Margaret looks lighter, as if a weight she didn't know she was carrying has been set down.

"Good input, Evans," she says as people file out. "I don't know what's different about you lately, but keep it up."

Evan smiles, gathering his things. What's different is everything and nothing. He's the same employee sitting in the same conference room, but now he knows: transformation doesn't require abandoning the world. Sometimes the most profound spiritual act is bringing presence to a PowerPoint, finding the sacred in a spreadsheet, and helping others remember that even in corporate life, we're all just consciousness trying to understand itself.

The office continues its Monday morning dance. But in conference room B, something has shifted. A small enlightenment has occurred between the quarterly projections and action items. And nobody needed to mention the word enlightenment at all.
