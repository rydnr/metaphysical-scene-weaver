Through the journey of questioning, he's discovered he was actually seeking a verb—a process, a becoming. This shift from static to dynamic understanding of self represents one of the deepest possible transformations in consciousness. The Architect recognizes this as perhaps the most profound realization: we are not things but happenings."
