"I realized something yesterday: I haven't thought about 'finding myself' in months. I'm too busy being myself to look for myself."

The realization arrives during an ordinary moment—washing dishes after dinner, hands in warm water, mind nowhere in particular. Suddenly Evan notices what's absent: the constant background anxiety about identity, the perpetual self-searching that once defined his days. Its absence is so complete he hadn't noticed it leaving.

"I realized something yesterday"—the casual timing speaks volumes. Not a breakthrough moment of enlightenment but quiet noticing during daily life. Yesterday's realization, today's sharing. The lag suggests this isn't urgent revelation but gentle recognition, interesting enough to mention but not emergency to proclaim.

"I haven't thought about"—negative space defining positive change. What we stop thinking about often reveals more than what we start thinking. The absence of obsessive self-searching marks deeper transformation than any positive practice could indicate.

"Finding myself"—the phrase now sounds quaint, like outdated slang from another era. The whole concept of self as lost object needing discovery has simply evaporated. Not rejected or transcended but forgotten, like childhood belief in tooth fairy—not fought against, just outgrown.

The dishes continue their journey from dirty to clean, each plate a simple transformation requiring no existential weight. Evan remembers when every activity was referendum on identity: "What kind of person washes dishes this way?" Now dishes are just dishes, washing just washing.

"In months"—duration suggesting thorough integration. Not days or weeks but months of living without the search. The seeking ended so gradually he can't pinpoint when. Like healing wound, you notice one day the pain is gone, has been gone, without marking the moment of cessation.

This isn't spiritual bypassing or avoidance. The question "What am I?" still arises, still receives engagement. But it no longer drives desperate searching. The question has become contemplation rather than crisis, inquiry rather than emergency.

"I'm too busy"—but not frantic busyness of avoidance. Rather, the natural fullness of engaged life. When you're actively being, the search for being becomes redundant. Like looking for your glasses while wearing them—the search only makes sense if you've forgotten you already have what you seek.

"Being myself"—present continuous verb, ongoing activity. Not "I am myself" with its implications of fixed achievement but "being myself" with its acknowledgment of continuous creation. Identity as performance rather than possession, process rather than product.

The simplicity of this formulation delights. Being myself—what else is there to do? What else has there ever been to do? The complexity came from thinking "myself" was something other than the being happening right now. The search created the distance it tried to close.

"To look for myself"—the redundancy now obvious. How can the seeker find the seeker? Where would myself go that I would need to look? The whole enterprise reveals itself as consciousness creating elaborate game of hide-and-seek with itself.

Yet Evan feels no judgment toward past searching. That seeking served its purpose, exhausted itself into finding. Like ladder you kick away after climbing, the search was necessary until it wasn't. He honors the years of looking that led to simple being.

The kitchen quiet holds evening peace. Through window, city lights begin their nightly constellation. Somewhere out there, others are desperately seeking themselves, reading books, attending workshops, interrogating their depths. Evan wishes them well on their necessary journeys.

"Too busy being"—this busyness includes stillness. Being myself washing dishes, being myself sitting quietly, being myself in conversation. The being fills all available space, leaves no room for searching. Fullness not of activity but of presence.

He dries the last plate, ordinary completion of ordinary task. No achievement beyond clean dishes, no identity confirmed or denied. Just someone who was washing dishes now someone putting them away. The flow of being continues without commentary.

What am I that forgot to search for what I am? What are you that's too present to be absent? What is this being that excludes seeking through its fullness?

The evening continues its quiet unfolding. Evan moves through his apartment—being myself reading, being myself preparing for bed, being myself noticing the absence of desperate questions. The search has ended not in finding but in forgetting to search.

This might be the deepest teaching: transformation happens not through dramatic revelation but through quiet forgetting. One day you simply notice you're no longer doing what once consumed you. The problem didn't get solved—it dissolved through lack of attention.

"Being myself to look for myself"—the phrase makes him smile. Like being too busy breathing to look for air, too busy walking to find his feet. The search for self was always like this—unnecessary activity preventing natural function.

Tomorrow he'll continue being himself, too busy with the being to remember the old searching. The question "What am I?" might arise, will be met with curiosity or ignored, won't trigger frantic seeking. Being has become sufficient unto itself.

The realization settles like sediment in still water—noticed yesterday, shared today, already integrating into the continuity of being that needs no finding because it never was lost.
