"The question hasn't changed, but I have become large enough to hold it without strain."

Late afternoon finds Evan in the public library, surrounded by philosophy books he no longer needs to read. He's here for the atmosphere, the quiet concentration of others seeking knowledge, the weight of accumulated human inquiry. His hand rests on a volume of existential philosophy, but he's not searching anymore—just appreciating the search itself.

"The question hasn't changed"—still the same words: "What am I?" Still the same fundamental mystery that has driven human consciousness since it first recognized itself in reflection. The question remains as potent, as essential, as unanswerable as ever. This constancy brings comfort now rather than frustration.

The library holds thousands of attempts to answer unanswerable questions. Every book represents someone's wrestling match with mystery. Evan feels kinship with all these seekers, living and dead, who filled pages with their particular angles on the eternal puzzles. The question unites across centuries.

"But I have become"—not through effort but through exhaustion of effort. Like a container that expands through being filled, Evan's capacity grew through engaging the question rather than avoiding it. Each circuit of the spiral, each therapy session, each moment of despair—all served to increase his holding capacity.

"Large enough"—largeness not of ego but of awareness. The small self that first asked "What am I?" expecting simple answer has expanded into something vast enough to contain paradox, comfortable with mystery, spacious enough for questions to echo without creating panic.

He thinks of a child trying to hold the ocean in their hands, frustrated as water slips through fingers. The adult knows better—you hold ocean by swimming in it, by becoming part of it, by recognizing you were always mostly water anyway. The question is held similarly, through inclusion rather than grasp.

"To hold it"—holding like a mother holds a child, with strength that includes softness. The question rests in his awareness like a familiar weight, sometimes shifting, sometimes still, always present but no longer overwhelming. He's developed the psychological musculature for this holding.

A student nearby struggles with her reading, furrowed brow suggesting encounter with difficult ideas. Evan recognizes the tension of mind trying to force understanding. He was her, is her, will be her again in different contexts. The struggle is honorable even though—especially though—it leads to larger holding rather than final answer.

"Without strain"—this ease didn't come easily. Like a pianist whose effortless performance required years of practice, Evan's comfortable relationship with existential questions was earned through discomfort. The strain was necessary to develop strength; now strength makes strainlessness possible.

The question sits in his consciousness like an old friend in his living room—familiar presence requiring no special attention. They've spent so much time together that formalities have dropped away. The question is just there, part of the furniture of consciousness, comfortable in its corner.

"Without strain"—but also without indifference. The ease isn't dismissive but inclusive. Like an experienced parent who can hold a crying child without being overwhelmed by the crying, Evan holds the question's urgency without being urgent himself. The question matters and doesn't matter simultaneously.

He opens the philosophy book randomly, finding someone else's attempt to answer what can't be answered. The words are beautiful, sincere, ultimately insufficient—as all words must be when facing the infinite. But the attempt itself moves him. Here's another human being who grew large through questioning.

The library's quiet concentration feels like collective meditation. Everyone here expanding their capacity to hold complexity, mystery, knowledge that raises more questions than it answers. The building itself is container for containers, minds holding ideas holding questions holding mystery.

Late light through tall windows casts long shadows, and Evan sees how he too is shadow and light—question and spaciousness, seeking and finding, small self and large awareness. The integration is complete. He hasn't answered "What am I?" but has become large enough to be both question and questioner.

What am I that grew to hold what once held me? What are you that expands through engagement with mystery? What is this consciousness that becomes larger through wrestling with its own nature?

The library session ends, but the holding continues. Evan returns books he didn't need to read, nods to the struggling student with silent encouragement, walks back into the world as someone who has become large enough to hold the questions that once threatened to break him.

The question remains his constant companion, but now it's like carrying capacity rather than weight. He has become psychological gymnasium where the question exercises itself, growing stronger through the workout while he grows stronger through providing space for its movement. Both are larger for their long relationship.

"Without strain"—the freedom in this. To engage profound questions without being crushed by them. To hold mystery without demanding resolution. To be large enough that even infinite questions find sufficient space. This is what the spiral taught, what the architect facilitated, what suffering transformed into: vast capacity for gentle holding of what cannot be held any other way.
