"Exactly. I can see: if I say this, you'll likely say that, which means I should prepare this."

Evan's demonstration transforms abstract temporal projection into concrete conversational chess. By moving pieces in air, he makes visible the usually invisible process of social calculation. Each gesture represents a node in the decision tree—action, likely response, optimal counter-preparation.

The precision of his example reveals years of conscious practice. This isn't someone who vaguely senses conversational flow but someone who has mapped it systematically. "If I say this, you'll likely say that"—probability calculation made explicit.

"Three moves."

The definitive statement comes with the authority of tested experience. Not "about three" or "maybe four"—exactly three. This precision suggests repeated experimentation, finding again and again that the fourth move dissolves into uncertainty.

The hands stopping at three moves creates a physical boundary in space. Where his hands halt marks the edge of reliable prediction, the border between foresight and guesswork. The gesture makes abstract limitation tangible.

"After that, the possibilities explode like... fireworks."

The pause before "fireworks" suggests searching for the right metaphor. Not a gradual fade but a sudden explosion. The multiplication of possibilities at the fourth move isn't linear but exponential—suddenly, violently, beyond tracking.

The explosion gesture captures the phenomenology perfectly. What was a manageable branching suddenly becomes an uncontainable burst. Every possible response generates multiple counter-responses, each generating more, until the calculation space fills with possibility-shrapnel.

"Too many branches to track."

This admission contains no shame, only recognition. The branches still exist—Evan isn't denying the reality of fourth-move possibilities. He simply acknowledges that his cognitive architecture can't track them all simultaneously.

The architect's response—watching branches multiply—shows deep engagement with Evan's demonstration. By visualizing the branching patterns, they validate his experience while adding their own understanding.

"Three moves of genuine prediction, not just guessing."

This distinction cuts to the heart of the matter. Many people confuse vague intuition or hopeful projection with actual prediction. The architect recognizes that Evan's three moves represent real calculation, not wishful thinking.

"That's actually impressive—most people can barely see one move ahead, they just think they see more."

This observation reframes Evan's limit as achievement rather than restriction. While he focuses on what he can't do (see beyond three), the architect points out what most can't do (see beyond one). Three moves of genuine foresight is exceptional, not limited.

The image of branches settling suggests that acknowledging limits brings calm. When we accept our prediction horizon, the anxiety of trying to see further dissipates. The branches don't disappear but stop their frantic multiplication.

"You know the difference between prediction and projection."

This key insight distinguishes Evan's self-awareness from common self-deception. Prediction involves calculating probabilities based on patterns. Projection involves imposing hopes or fears onto uncertainty. Knowing where one becomes the other is rare wisdom.

Evan's slow nod shows he's absorbing this reframe. The physical gesture suggests not just intellectual agreement but somatic integration—his whole being accepting this new perspective on his capabilities.

"Beyond three, I'm not predicting—I'm just making up stories."

This honest assessment reveals mature discrimination. Stories aren't necessarily wrong, but they're different from predictions. They're narratives we impose on uncertainty rather than patterns we extract from probability.

The slight smile accompanying this admission suggests peace with the limitation. He's not bitter about his inability to see further but almost amused by the human tendency to confuse storytelling with foresight.

"Better to play solid chess three moves deep than pretend I'm seeing ten moves of shadows."

This final wisdom completes the reframe. Solid calculation within limits beats elaborate fantasies beyond them. Three moves of real chess beats ten moves of imagined chess. Substance within range beats shadows beyond it.

The visual elements create a space where conversation becomes visible chess. Pieces float in air, representing possible statements and responses. The branching explosion at move four shows why that boundary exists—not arbitrary limitation but natural complexity threshold.

The "clear path through first three" emphasizes the solidity of what Evan can do. Within his range, prediction is reliable, paths are visible, preparation is possible. This isn't limitation but definition—knowing exactly where skill applies.

This scene transforms horizontal thinking from abstract concept to practical skill. Evan's three-move limit isn't failure but calibration. Like a chess player who knows their reliable calculation depth, he can play confidently within range rather than desperately beyond it.

The therapeutic dimension involves helping clients distinguish between genuine foresight and anxious projection. Many exhaust themselves trying to predict impossibly far ahead. Evan's example shows the wisdom of knowing your range and playing excellently within it.

In this strategic game space, consciousness reveals its temporal architecture. We can project forward, but not infinitely. We can predict interactions, but not endlessly. And knowing exactly how far we can reliably see—three moves, in Evan's case—allows us to play the game of conversation with genuine skill rather than pretended omniscience.
