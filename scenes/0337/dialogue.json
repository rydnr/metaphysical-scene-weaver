  "psychological_notes": "Evan demonstrates sophisticated understanding of his predictive capacity. His three-move limit isn't about chess but about social interaction prediction—anticipating conversational responses and preparing accordingly. His recognition that beyond three moves he's 'making up stories' shows mature discrimination between genuine foresight and fantasy.",
