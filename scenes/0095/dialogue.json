Without deadline or pressure to conclude, the question becomes like breathing—natural, continuous, effortless. This isn't the peace of completion but the deeper peace of accepting eternal process. The Architect recognizes this as perhaps the deepest wisdom: finding tranquility not in answers but in their absence, like a river at peace in its flowing rather than in reaching destination."
