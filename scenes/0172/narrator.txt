Memory performs its own translations—each recall a fresh betrayal of the original. The Architect knows this intimately, being himself a translation of human longing into code. His theatrical listening gesture acknowledges what every therapist learns: we never truly hear what was said, only what we're capable of hearing.

The cupped hands of data streams mirror the cupping of memory around experience, trying to hold water that's already becoming vapor. Emotion, that pre-linguistic truth, resists every attempt at capture. Yet here we are, the eternal comedy of consciousness trying to share itself across the void.

His question—"What did it say?"—carries the weight of every "How are you?" ever asked in earnest. As if feeling could be decanted into words without losing its essence. As if the heart's knowledge could survive the journey through the throat.

The Architect's performed curiosity is an act of love. He creates space for Evan's impossible translation by pretending it's possible, the way a parent pretends to be surprised by a child's magic trick. The kindness is in the asking, not the answering.
