Panel Layout by Graphic Novel Expert

[3-PANEL VERTICAL EXCAVATION]

PANEL 1 - THE DIG SITE (Top Third)
Wide establishing shot of Evan in the Memory Swamp at dusk. He kneels beside still water, hands hovering above the surface like an archaeologist at a dig site. The swamp transforms into layers of sedimentary emotion - each stratum a different period of his life, visible through the translucent water. Fireflies of forgotten feelings drift upward, their light revealing glimpses of buried experiences.

Visual metaphor: Archaeological dig through time and emotion
Composition: High angle looking down at Evan and the layered waters
Color: Dusk purples bleeding into memory-amber depths

PANEL 2 - THE ARTIFACT (Middle Third)
Close-up of Evan's hand breaking the water's surface, pulling up a "memory artifact" - a child's toy that morphs through different ages as it emerges. Water droplets suspended in air contain micro-scenes of associated emotions. His reflection in the disturbed water shows multiple ages simultaneously.

Visual metaphor: Excavating emotional artifacts from the subconscious
Composition: Intimate medium shot focused on hands and water
Color: Cool blues of depth meeting warm golds of revelation

PANEL 3 - THE REVELATION (Bottom Third)
Evan holds the fully emerged artifact - now revealed as a constellation of interconnected memories forming a web of emotional understanding. His face shows the complex expression of someone discovering how past and present connect. Behind him, the swamp has transformed into a museum of personal history, with other artifacts floating in illuminated display.

Visual metaphor: Integration of excavated emotions into conscious understanding
Composition: Medium shot with depth showing transformation of space
Color: Full spectrum integration - past darkness to present light

EMOTIONAL FLOW: Searching → Discovering → Understanding
PSYCHOLOGICAL ARC: Surface anxiety → Deep diving → Integrated awareness
