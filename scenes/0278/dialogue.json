      "text": "If you only ever act in ways that protect you from cost, you're not freeâ€”you're managed by your fears. But if there were no cost, no stakes, then your actions wouldn't matter. You'd be choosing between paper and more paper."

Too little consequence and our choices become arbitrary. The 'paper and more paper' metaphor brilliantly captures the emptiness of consequence-free choice.",
  "philosophical_underpinning": "Meaningful freedom exists in the space between paralysis and meaninglessness",
  "therapeutic_direction": "Finding the courage to risk while accepting the necessity of consequence"
