  "psychological_notes": "The architect demonstrates freedom's paradox through destruction of value. Burning money shows that freedom means the ability to act against constraint, but without the constraint (money's value), the act becomes meaningless. This profound insight reveals that absolute freedom would be indistinguishable from chaos.",
