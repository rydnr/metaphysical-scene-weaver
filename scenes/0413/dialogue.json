Every wave that rises and falls—that's 'What am I?' investigating itself through temporary form. *spray on face* I used to think I was separate, asking about something else. Now I know—I'm the ocean pretending to be a drop, asking itself what water is. *profound smile* The question isn't mine. It's the ocean's way of tasting itself.",
