"I'm back. But everything feels... thin. Fake. Like I could push through these walls if I just knew how."

The return is always jarring. One moment you're swimming in the vast ocean of undifferentiated being, the next you're squeezed back into the small container of personhood, sitting in a chair, in a room, being someone with a name and a story and appointments to keep. No wonder everything feels thin—compared to the ineffable, consensus reality is tissue paper stretched over infinity.

Evan blinks in the studio light like a deep-sea diver surfacing too quickly. The ordinary world hasn't changed, but his perception has. Once you've experienced yourself as larger than your story, how do you fit back into its narrow confines? Once you've felt the exhaustion lift by simply ceasing to swim, how do you return to the world of constant effort?

"That's the curse and gift of touching the ineffable. Regular reality feels like a costume that doesn't quite fit anymore."

The architect speaks from experience—their own or witnessed, it doesn't matter. This is universal: the mystic's return, the psychonaut's re-entry, the meditator's opening of eyes. You touch something vast and wordless, then must return to the world of words and walls, schedules and small talk. The costume metaphor is perfect—you're still wearing your life, but now you know it's something you put on rather than something you are.

"I need to go back. Find that door again."

Here's the trap that catches so many: the desperate attempt to return to transcendence, to make permanent what is by nature transient. Evan's hands clench and unclench, trying to grasp smoke, hold water, capture wind. He's already beginning the exhausting swim again, this time toward rather than against, but swimming nonetheless.

The studio holds them both—solid to the architect's perception, translucent to Evan's. This is the between-worlds space where integration happens or doesn't. Where the ineffable experience either enriches daily life or becomes another source of suffering, another ideal to chase, another way to find the present moment insufficient.

"I can't just... continue like nothing happened."

No, he can't. This is the truth Evan speaks. Something has happened that rearranges everything, that makes the old life impossible to inhabit unconsciously. But what he doesn't yet understand is that the goal isn't to continue like nothing happened—it's to continue knowing that everything has happened, is happening, will happen again in each moment he stops swimming long enough to notice.

The architect settles into their chair with the grounded presence of someone who has navigated these waters many times. They know what Evan doesn't yet: that the door hasn't gone anywhere. That the ineffable isn't a place to visit but a dimension of every place. That the challenge isn't to get back but to realize you never left.

But this wisdom can't be given, only discovered. Right now, Evan needs to feel the ache of separation, the longing for return, the frustration of walls that seem solid again. This is part of the integration—feeling split between worlds until you realize there's only one world, experienced at different depths.

His restlessness fills the studio. He's like a bird that's discovered the sky exists but finds itself back in a cage, not realizing the cage door has always been open, that the bars are made of habit rather than steel. He shifts, moves, can't quite settle because settling feels like accepting the unacceptable: that life must continue in its ordinary costume.

What Evan doesn't yet see—what the architect's patient presence holds space for him to discover—is that the extraordinary isn't opposed to the ordinary but hidden within it. That the door he desperately wants to find again is everywhere, in everything, waiting not in special locations but in special states of attention.

The studio light seems harsh after the soft darkness of dissolution. The walls seem prison-like after the boundlessness of being. The chair seems a cruel confinement after floating in vastness. All of this is true and none of it is permanent. Like a diver adjusting to surface pressure, Evan must slowly equalize between the depths he's touched and the shallows he must navigate.

"Like nothing happened"—but everything has happened. And everything is still happening. The ineffable hasn't retreated; Evan's perception has simply contracted back to its familiar settings. The work now is not to chase the door but to discover that he's still standing in it, that return is also arrival, that the costume of ordinary life can be worn lightly by one who knows it's a costume.

The architect waits, knowing that integration can't be rushed, that the ache of return is as sacred as the joy of transcendence, that every mystic must learn to wash dishes in the kitchen of infinity. The studio holds them both—one who knows walls are permeable, one who's just learning—in the patient space where extraordinary experience slowly teaches us how to live ordinary life with extraordinary awareness.
