"Vertically, I can reason about the context that surrounds each decision, and infer how my limitations can make me blind to aspects that I might later find obvious once I see them."

The stick becomes a teaching tool as Evan draws a vertical line crossing the horizontal one he just made. The ground beneath his feet transforms into a map of consciousness, marked with the precision of someone who has thoroughly explored the territory.

This vertical line represents something profound—not just the ability to go meta, but specifically the capacity to reason about context. It's one thing to think about thinking; it's another to understand the invisible framework within which all thinking occurs. Evan has learned to see the water he swims in, at least to a depth of two levels.

"The context that surrounds each decision"—this awareness marks sophisticated psychological development. Most people make decisions within contexts they never examine. They choose from menus they didn't write, in restaurants they didn't know they'd entered. But Evan has learned to see the menu, the restaurant, and even glimpse the cultural forces that created both.

The most striking insight comes in the second half: "infer how my limitations can make me blind to aspects that I might later find obvious once I see them." This is meta-cognitive humility at its finest. He knows that he doesn't know what he doesn't know. He's aware that his current blindness will only become visible in retrospect.

This awareness of future obviousness is particularly sophisticated. It suggests Evan has experienced this cycle enough times to recognize the pattern: struggle with a problem within one context, suddenly see the context itself, realize the problem was created by unexamined assumptions, feel foolish for not seeing it earlier, then wonder what current contexts remain invisible.

The vertical line he draws represents this stack of contexts. At ground level: the immediate decision. One level up: the framework creating the decision. Two levels up: the assumptions creating the framework. And there his vision fails, though he knows a third level exists—he just can't see it yet.

This limitation in vertical thinking isn't failure but honest self-assessment. Like knowing you need glasses because distant objects blur, recognizing where your meta-cognition fails is itself a form of meta-cognition. Evan has mapped the exact altitude where his consciousness hits its ceiling.

"Can make me blind"—the active voice here matters. Limitations don't just exist passively; they actively create blindness. They're not mere boundaries but generators of invisibility. What we can't think shapes what we can't see. Our cognitive architecture creates our perceptual reality.

The physical act of drawing these lines grounds abstract concepts in concrete action. Evan isn't just thinking about thinking; he's literally mapping it on the earth. The cross he's creating becomes a coordinate system for consciousness, with horizontal breadth and vertical depth marked in dirt and stick.

What fascinates is how this vertical capacity relates to his therapeutic journey. Each breakthrough with the architect likely involved ascending one contextual level—seeing that his questions emerged from assumptions, his assumptions from frameworks, his frameworks from... something still invisible at the third level.

"That I might later find obvious"—this temporal aspect adds another dimension. Evan understands that future-Evan will look back at present-Evan with the gentle condescension of expanded awareness. He's been through this cycle enough to expect it, even welcome it. Today's struggling is tomorrow's "how did I not see that?"

But there's no frustration in this acknowledgment, just matter-of-fact mapping. Like a cartographer noting "here be dragons" at the map's edge, Evan marks where his vertical reasoning ends without shame or striving. He's learned the wisdom of working within known limits while remaining open to their eventual transcendence.

The cross on the ground grows more significant with each addition. Not a religious symbol but a coordinate system for consciousness, a way of mapping the unmappable territory of self-aware awareness. X marks the spot where horizontal foresight meets vertical insight, and Evan stands at their intersection.

What am I that can map my own blindness? What are you that sees the contexts I swim in? What is this consciousness that knows it doesn't know what it doesn't know?

The vertical line complete, Evan has drawn half a map of his mental topology. The stick that traces limits also points beyond them, a compass needle aimed at territories that exist but can't yet be seen. In drawing his boundaries, he's also drawn arrows pointing past them—because knowing where sight fails is the beginning of learning to see.
