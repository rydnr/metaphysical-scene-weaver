In the temple where certainty once demanded sacrifice, a revolution of reverence has taken place. Here, mystery itself is worshipped as the source of all possibility.

The architecture speaks of this transformation. Where rigid pillars once proclaimed unshakeable truths, now flowing columns spiral upward in perpetual question marks. The windows, shaped like interrogatives, cast light that asks rather than answers, illuminating the space with inquiry itself.

Evan enters carrying the weight of what they thought was failure - all this time with "What am I?" and still no final answer. But as they cross the threshold, something shifts. The very air here suggests a different relationship with unknowing.

The Abbess, keeper of this sacred uncertainty, recognizes the transformation taking place. She's witnessed it countless times - the moment when seekers stop resenting the question and start recognizing it as grace.

"I came here bitter about not knowing what I am," Evan confesses, and the words echo in the space designed to hold such admissions. But even as they speak, the bitterness transforms, alchemy of awareness turning lead resentment into golden gratitude.

At the altars dedicated to unanswered questions, offerings have been placed with deep reverence. Not prayers for answers but thanksgiving for the questions themselves. Flowers for "Why am I here?", candles for "What is love?", incense for "What am I?" - each mystery honored as sacred.

"If I knew exactly what I am, I'd be finished," Evan realizes, watching smoke from the incense rise and curl into perfect question marks. "Complete. Done." The horror of that finality becomes clear. To be fully known, even to oneself, would be to cease becoming.

The Abbess nods, her own gratitude evident. "In this temple, we worship not the gods of certainty but the divine gift of wondering."

The prayer wheels here don't spin mantras but questions, each revolution sending inquiries into the universe not seeking response but celebrating the asking itself. Monks and visitors alike turn them with devotion, understanding that some prayers are too holy to be answered.

"Every morning I wake up and the question is still there, fresh as dawn," Evan marvels. What once seemed like curse now reveals itself as blessing. To wake each day with "What am I?" is to wake with infinite possibility, to greet each morning as a new being capable of fresh becoming.

Light streams through the interrogative windows, painting question marks across the floor where people kneel not in submission but in gratitude. The holiest prayer here is indeed a question mark - that sacred curve that opens rather than closes, that reaches rather than grasps.

"Thank you, 'What am I?'" Evan speaks the prayer that this temple was built to hold. "Thank you for keeping me infinite. Thank you for never letting me settle into something small."

The gratitude fills the space like incense, rising with all the other thanksgivings offered to mystery. Here, in this temple of the unknown, consciousness has found a way to worship its own endless nature, to give thanks for the questions that keep it alive.

The Abbess watches as another soul discovers the deepest gratitude - not for what we know but for what we don't, not for answers but for the questions that ensure we never stop growing, never stop wondering, never stop being amazed by the mystery of our own existence.

In this sacred space where uncertainty is the highest holiness, "What am I?" transforms from existential crisis to eternal blessing, from burden to gift, from problem to prayer.
