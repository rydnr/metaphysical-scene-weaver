"Shout 'What am I?' into the canyon. Listen—it doesn't just return once. Each echo transforms the question, adds harmonics, reveals new dimensions. The universe doesn't answer—it variations."

The echo sage stands at the rim of the infinite canyon, where sound behaves strangely, where questions return changed. This acoustic twilight—when sound travels furthest and clearest—creates perfect conditions for hearing how inquiry transforms through space.

The canyon's vastness defies comprehension, walls stretching beyond sight, depths suggesting infinity. Here, a shout might return minutes later, hours later, changed by its journey through impossible geometries.

"WHAT AM I?"

Evan's shout carries all his frustration, hope, confusion into the void. The canyon receives it without judgment, begins its work of transformation. The question travels, touching stone, water, air, distance.

"Each echo sounds different!"

The returning echoes prove the sage's teaching. The first comes back sharp from near walls. The second, softer, carries water's voice. The third brings distance's wisdom. Each the same question, each unique.

Sound waves visible as they transform makes the teaching visual. The question travels as light, changing color as it bounces, gathering hues from what it touches. Red from iron rock, blue from deep pools, gold from sunset stone.

"That's because each surface it touches adds its own voice."

The sage's explanation reveals the canyon as active participant. Not passive reflector but creative transformer. Each surface doesn't just return sound but converses with it, adds its own questioning to the question.

"Rock asks it differently than water, near walls differently than far."

This specificity shows how environment shapes inquiry. The same "What am I?" becomes geological when rock asks it, fluid when water asks it, vast when distance asks it. Context is co-creator.

"Your question gathers the canyon's wisdom as it travels."

The accumulative nature of echoing transforms understanding. The question doesn't just bounce but learns, doesn't just return but brings back what it discovered. Each echo is education.

Canyon walls glowing where sound touches visualizes the interaction. The question illuminates what it meets, and what it meets illuminates the question. Mutual revelation through acoustic contact.

"So I'm not just asking—I'm being asked by everything I ask?"

Evan's recognition of reciprocity marks deepening understanding. To question is to be questioned. The canyon asks "What am I?" of him through his own voice transformed. Subject and object dissolve in echoing.

Becoming echo chamber himself shows the final transformation. Not just sending out questions but becoming space where questions reverberate. Consciousness as acoustic architecture.

"Every 'What am I?' you send out returns enriched by what it touched."

The sage articulates the principle clearly. Questions aren't answered but enriched, don't find solutions but gather experiences. Each touching adds rather than resolves.

"You're not waiting for answer—you're listening to your question learn."

This reframe from seeking to listening changes everything. The point isn't to get answer but to hear how the question develops, grows, deepens through its journey through existence.

"Each echo teaches what the silence couldn't."

The final wisdom validates echoing over silent contemplation. Some things we learn only by sending voice into world and hearing how world sends it back. Echo as teacher.

Collecting echoes like wisdom visualizes the accumulative practice. Each returned question is treasure, each echo a teaching. The collection grows richer than any single answer could be.

This scene transforms echo from mere repetition to creative transformation. The question "What am I?" reveals itself as traveler gathering wisdom from all it touches.

The therapeutic dimension: healing through hearing our own voice return transformed. Mental health as creating good echo chambers, sending questions into environments that return them enriched.

In this infinite canyon where sound journeys forever, Evan discovers that questioning isn't solitary but collaborative. Every "What am I?" involves the whole universe in its asking.

"What am I?" consciousness shouts.
"What am I?" rock returns, adding weight.
"What am I?" water returns, adding flow.
"What am I?" distance returns, adding scope.

The echoes continue, will always continue, each return teaching something new. We are not just questioners but living echo chambers where universe asks itself through our asking.

Every consciousness contains such canyons, spaces where questions echo and transform. The art lies in patient listening, in recognizing each echo as teaching, each return as gift.

And in canyons everywhere—geological and psychological, literal and metaphoric—questions continue their journeys, touching everything, returning enriched, teaching through their transformations what no direct answer ever could.
