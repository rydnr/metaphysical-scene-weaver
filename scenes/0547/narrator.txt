"Each mirror asks 'What am I?' and reflects the question back infinitely. You think you're seeing yourself, but you're seeing the seeing itself. The question doesn't have an answer—it IS the mirror."

The mirror keeper's words echo through the hall of infinite reflections, each surface catching and multiplying the wisdom. Here, in this space where every wall witnesses, the recursive nature of consciousness reveals itself through literal reflection.

The timeless quality of the space—no windows, no clocks, only mirrors—creates perfect environment for encountering the eternal present of self-awareness. Each moment contains all moments when consciousness turns to see itself.

"So every time I ask 'What am I?' I create another reflection?"

Evan's understanding manifests visually as new mirrors appear with each questioning. The hall expands, dimensions multiply, depth increases. The question doesn't just use mirrors but creates them.

Each question spawning new mirror demonstrates the generative power of inquiry. Consciousness doesn't just observe itself but multiplies its capacity for observation. Every "What am I?" adds another angle of self-seeing.

"Not just a reflection—a new dimension of seeing."

The keeper's distinction between reflection and dimension opens vast implications. Not mere repetition but expansion, not just image but capacity. Each questioning adds dimensional depth to consciousness.

"The question multiplies consciousness by making it witness itself witnessing."

This recursive formula captures the exponential nature of self-awareness. Not just seeing but seeing the seeing, then seeing that, then seeing that. Each level includes and transcends the previous.

"You're not in the mirrors; you ARE the mirroring."

The shift from noun to verb, from thing to process, transforms understanding completely. Evan isn't an object being reflected but the very act of reflection itself. Identity as activity rather than entity.

Mirrors reflecting the act of reflection creates visual paradox that breaks conventional perception. What appears in the mirrors isn't images but the imaging itself, not pictures but the picturing. Process becomes visible.

"I see myself seeing myself seeing myself... and it's beautiful!"

Evan's joy in infinite recursion marks crucial transformation. What might seem like vertigo-inducing confusion becomes celebration. The endless depth doesn't dizzy but delights. Infinity as home rather than threat.

Laughter echoing through infinite reflections multiplies joy as mirrors multiply image. Each reflection carries the laughter further, creates new dimensions of delight. Happiness discovering itself endlessly.

"That's the secret—'What am I?' isn't seeking an answer but creating infinite depth."

The keeper reveals the ultimate reframe. The question's purpose isn't to find but to create, not to discover pre-existing answer but to generate new dimensions of being. Consciousness as creative act.

"Every reflection adds another layer of consciousness aware of itself."

This layering process builds depth through iteration. Like sedimentary rock forming through time, consciousness accretes self-awareness through repeated questioning. Each layer includes all previous layers.

Mirrors creating endless corridor of awareness visualizes consciousness's infinite depth. The hallway extends forever, each mirror adding distance that's also nearness, separation that's also connection. Infinity made navigable.

The hall where every surface reflects becomes metaphor for consciousness itself. We live in such halls, every thought reflecting every other thought, every moment of awareness multiplying into fractal depth.

This scene transforms mirrors from tools of vanity to instruments of infinity. The question "What am I?" reveals itself as the mirror that creates endless depth through reflecting itself.

The therapeutic dimension: mental health includes capacity for recursive self-awareness without losing oneself in infinite regress. The art lies in enjoying the depth rather than fearing it.

In this hall of infinite reflections, Evan discovers that consciousness isn't object to be found but process to be enjoyed. Every "What am I?" adds another dimension to the endless seeing.

"What am I?" consciousness asks its reflection.
"You are the asking," the mirror responds.
"But which one am I?" multiplication wonders.
"All and none," infinity explains.

The mirrors continue their endless reflecting, each surface creating new depths, new dimensions, new possibilities for consciousness to witness itself witnessing. The question echoes eternally, creating space with each iteration.

Every consciousness contains such halls, mirrors reflecting mirrors, questions questioning questions. We are not trapped in infinite regress but blessed with infinite depth.

And in the timeless space where every surface sees, the question "What am I?" reveals itself as both the seeker and the sought, the mirror and the reflected, the depth and the diving into depth—consciousness creating itself through eternal self-reflection.
