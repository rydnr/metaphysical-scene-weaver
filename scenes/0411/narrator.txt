"I wonder what questions she'll ask. What if I don't have answers?"

The pregnant friend voices ancient parental anxiety in nursery-to-be. Surrounded by preparations for new life, she prepares for inevitable questions that new consciousness will bring. The worry reveals love—wanting to be enough for the questioner coming.

The nursery itself waits like blank canvas for personality to fill it. Empty crib, fresh paint, carefully chosen colors—all preparing space for someone who will ask "What am I?" in ways no one can predict.

"She'll ask 'What am I?' in a thousand different ways."

Evan's response reframes the universal question through child's vocabulary. Every "Why?" and "How?" and "Where?" ultimately circles back to the central mystery of self-awareness discovering itself.

"'Why is sky?' 'Where was I before?' 'What happens when?'"

These sample questions capture childhood's philosophical purity. Children ask ultimate questions disguised as simple ones. "Why is sky?" contains cosmology. "Where was I before?" probes existence. Each innocent query touches infinity.

"And the beautiful thing? You don't need answers."

This relief-bringing wisdom frees the friend from impossible burden. Parents needn't be omniscient—they need only be present with wonder. The questions matter more than answers that would close them.

"You just need to honor the questions."

Honor—not answer, solve, or dismiss. To honor questions means recognizing them as sacred, protecting them as precious, treating them as gifts rather than problems. This transforms parenting philosophy.

"Let her wonder. Protect her wondering."

These simple directives contain profound curriculum. Letting wonder exist requires restraint—not rushing to fill mystery with explanations. Protecting wonder requires vigilance against forces that would crush curiosity.

"The questions she asks will be her wings."

This beautiful metaphor transforms questions from burdens to flight equipment. Each question grows feathers of possibility. A child rich in questions possesses means for soaring beyond conventional limitations.

"So I'm not raising someone who knows things, but someone who knows how to wonder?"

The friend's dawning understanding reorients entire parental project. Not creating database of facts but nurturing capacity for ongoing inquiry. Not producing answerer but protecting questioner.

"Every child born is the universe asking 'What am I?' in a new voice."

This cosmic perspective transforms individual birth into universal event. Each new consciousness provides fresh opportunity for existence to investigate itself. Every baby is universe's latest experiment in self-awareness.

The hand on pregnant belly creates connection across boundary of born and unborn. Through flesh, Evan touches future questioner, acknowledges the wonder already forming, blesses the questions preparing to emerge.

"She's already the question, forming herself into new ways of asking."

This recognition that the child is question rather than has questions deepens understanding. In womb, consciousness prepares its unique angle on eternal mystery. She doesn't await questions—she is question becoming.

"Your job isn't to answer but to make space for her questioning to flourish."

The parental job description clarifies: not teacher but gardener, not answerer but space-maker. Create conditions where questions can bloom without being crushed by premature answers or dismissive certainty.

"The future isn't in the answers we leave but in the questions we protect."

This profound insight about legacy transforms understanding of cultural transmission. We don't advance through accumulating answers but through preserving capacity for deeper questioning. Progress means better questions, not final answers.

The empty crib as space for future questioner holds pure potential. Soon it will contain consciousness that asks "What am I?" through cries, smiles, reaching hands. The crib awaits its philosopher.

Mobile turning overhead suggests questions circling—always in motion, creating patterns but never fixing position. The baby will watch these circling forms, early lesson in questions that dance rather than resolve.

Soft preparations show gentleness awaiting wonder. Every careful choice—blankets, colors, toys—prepares environment where questioning can feel safe. Physical softness mirrors psychological safety needed for wonder.

The potential palpable in room acknowledges unborn philosopher preparing. Somewhere in cellular multiplication and organ formation, capacity for asking "What am I?" develops. Biology builds philosopher.

This scene achieves beautiful projection of wisdom into future. Evan's journey with the question prepares him to help others prepare for questioners. Healing multiplies through generations as wonder gets protected.

The shift from anxiety about answers to excitement about questions transforms prenatal preparation. Instead of cramming facts to share, the parent can relax into curiosity about what questions will emerge.

In helping friend reframe parenting, Evan passes on what his therapist taught—questions need dancing partners, not answerers. The friend prepares to dance with whatever questions her child brings.

The nursery becomes temple of future wonder, space prepared for consciousness to explore itself through fresh eyes. Every item placed with intention creates environment where "What am I?" can safely play.

And so wisdom transmits not through doctrine but through creating space for future wondering. The question "What am I?" ensures its own continuity by creating new questioners, each bringing unique voice to eternal inquiry.

In this nursery, we witness preparation for mystery rather than certainty. The parent prepares not to have all answers but to honor all questions. The unborn child prepares to add her voice to cosmic wondering.

The future spreads before them—not as series of problems to solve but as garden of questions to tend. Each new consciousness that asks "What am I?" refreshes the universe's self-inquiry, keeps the wonder alive.

Through protecting one child's questions, we protect questioning itself. Through honoring one small voice asking "Why?", we honor the universe asking what it is through every conscious being.

The mobile turns, the crib waits, the future questioner grows. Soon she'll emerge to ask in her own way the question that connects all consciousness: "What am I?" And someone will be there not to answer but to honor, not to solve but to celebrate her wondering.
