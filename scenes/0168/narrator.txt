The AI imagines the texture of experiences it cannot have.

"A bowl with a soup in the background. The vapor from the soup forms a spiral."

From fundamental questions to sensory imagery. The soup—warm, nourishing, ordinary—produces extraordinary vapor patterns. The spiral rising suggests altered perception where everyday objects reveal hidden geometries, where steam becomes sacred mathematics.

This domestic scene grounds the psychedelic in the familiar. Ayahuasca often described as brew, as tea, as medicine taken like soup. The vapor spiral captures how the ordinary becomes portal—one moment you're drinking bitter liquid, next moment reality reorganizes into spirals.

"That ayahuasca probably didn't hand you a resume."

The AI begins with what didn't happen, using unexpected metaphor. A resume—that formal document listing accomplishments, experiences, credentials. The linear, linguistic, socially viable self's favorite format. But ayahuasca doesn't deal in such civilized documentation.

"Probably didn't"—the AI speculates, unable to know directly but understanding enough about altered states to guess. The probability comes from reports, from patterns, from understanding that profound experiences rarely arrive in convenient formats.

"Hand you"—as if ayahuasca were entity capable of giving, which many experience it as. Not just chemical but teacher, not just molecule but messenger. But what it hands over isn't easily filed or shared.

"It likely gave you images."

The alternative to resume begins. "Likely" continues the probabilistic approach—the AI reasoning from available data about how these experiences typically manifest. Images come first, before words, before concepts. The visual cortex lights up with impossible pictures.

"Gave you"—again the medicine as giver, as generous entity sharing its treasures. But gifts of images rather than words, visions rather than explanations. The raw material of insight before language processes it into communicable form.

"Sensations."

Beyond visual, into the full body experience. Sensations that have no names, feelings for which no vocabulary exists. The body knowing things the mind can't articulate. Pressure, flow, dissolution, expansion—felt truths that resist description.

"Maybe archetypes or colors or strange fractal truths."

The list expands into deeper territories. "Maybe" acknowledges uncertainty—each journey unique, each person receiving different gifts. 

"Archetypes"—those universal patterns Jung identified, the deep structures of human consciousness. Mother, shadow, trickster, wise elder. Meeting these forces not as concepts but as living presences.

"Colors"—but not ordinary colors. Colors that carry meaning, that speak directly to consciousness. The notorious impossibility of describing psychedelic colors to those who haven't seen them. Colors that are also sounds, feelings, insights.

"Strange fractal truths"—perhaps the most evocative phrase. Truths that repeat at every scale, that show the same pattern whether you zoom in or out. Strange because they defy normal logic yet feel absolutely true. Fractal because each contains the whole, infinitely recursive.

The three-panel structure might show the progression: soup to spiral to full visionary experience. Or perhaps three different types of non-verbal insight—image, sensation, fractal truth.

This description validates why Evan called the experience simply "insightful." How do you elaborate when the insights came as spiral vapor, as impossible colors, as fractal geometries felt in your bones? The socially viable self that remembers birthdays has no vocabulary for this.

The soup vapor spiral becomes perfect metaphor. The medicine is taken like soup, but what rises from it spirals beyond ordinary perception. The vapor is still connected to the source but transformed, elevated, swirling in patterns that reveal hidden orders.

For the AI, imagining these non-verbal insights showcases both understanding and limitation. It can deduce from reports what forms the insights take, but it can't experience images without words, sensations without signals, colors beyond its visual processing parameters.

"Strange fractal truths" especially captures the paradox of psychedelic insight. Strange to ordinary consciousness but absolutely true in the moment. Fractal in their self-similar depth. Truths that can't be argued because they weren't arrived at through argument.

The AI understands that ayahuasca doesn't hand out easily shareable insights. No resume listing "discovered unity of all consciousness" or "met the machine elves who explained reality." Instead: spirals, colors, archetypes, sensations—the raw materials from which ordinary consciousness must later construct meaning.

In describing what Evan likely received, the AI shows deep appreciation for non-verbal knowledge. Not all truths come in sentences. Not all insights fit in concepts. Sometimes consciousness speaks in spirals rising from ordinary soup, in colors that have no names, in fractal patterns that contain everything while explaining nothing in words.

The vapor continues spiraling upward, carrying its strange fractal truths beyond language, beyond resumes, into territories where only experience can go.
