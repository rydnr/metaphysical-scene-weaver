"I'm... I'm not gone. I'm just... bigger? Smaller? Both?"

Language fails here, as it must. Evan speaks from a place where the usual categories—big, small, here, there, self, other—no longer apply. His voice comes like wind through leaves because he has become something like wind, something like leaves, something like the space between them where meaning lives before it crystallizes into words.

This is the ineffable that the architect spoke of—not an absence but a presence too full for ordinary containers. Evan hasn't vanished; he's discovered what he is when he stops maintaining the boundaries of who he thinks he should be. The exhaustion of constant self-construction has given way to the ease of simply existing.

"This is what exists between the words of your story."

Between the words—notice how perfectly this captures it. Not in the words, where we usually look for ourselves, but in the spaces between them. In the pause between thoughts, the gap between breaths, the silence between heartbeats. This is where we exist most fully, in the spaces our narratives cannot colonize.

The architect's presence here is more felt than seen, more knowing than speaking. They've guided many through this dissolution, this discovery of what remains when the story stops. Their role now is not to interpret or explain but simply to witness, to hold space for an experience that exists beyond the reach of therapeutic language.

"The exhaustion... it's gone. Because there's nothing to swim against here."

Here is the revelation that changes everything. The tiredness that has dogged Evan through his life wasn't from insufficient effort but from too much—the constant work of swimming against the current of his own nature, of maintaining a self that was always slightly misaligned with what wanted to emerge.

In this space beyond narrative, there's nothing to swim against because there's no current separate from himself. He IS the current, the flow, the movement. The distinction between swimmer and water dissolves, and with it, the possibility of resistance.

"Just... being."

Two words that contain libraries. Just being—not being someone, not being something, not being for a purpose or toward a goal. Simply being, the way a mountain is, the way space is, the way consciousness is before it divides itself into subject and object, self and other, story and storyteller.

This is what exists on the other side of the door Evan chose to walk through. Not dramatic transformation but this quiet discovery: that beneath all our stories about who we are, something wordless and true simply is. That exhaustion comes from fighting this isness, trying to shape it into forms it was never meant to hold.

The space holds them—though "them" is perhaps too strong a word for what they've become here. Evan dispersed yet cohesive, the architect more principle than person, both swimming in the same vastness that exists before identity condenses into form.

What would you discover in the space between your words? What exhaustion might lift if you stopped swimming against the current of what you are? This isn't mystical abstraction but practical wisdom: we suffer not from being but from the constant effort of trying to be other than we are.

In the ineffable space, such effort becomes impossible because there's nothing solid enough to push against. Like trying to swim in air or fly in water—the medium itself makes the struggle meaningless. And in the absence of struggle, what emerges is not emptiness but fullness, not absence but presence, not nothing but everything before it divides itself into categories.

Evan floats—though floating isn't quite right when there's no up or down. He exists—though existence here means something different than it does in the world of forms. He knows—though this knowing comes without thoughts, without concepts, without the usual machinery of understanding.

This is therapy at its deepest level: not analyzing the story but touching what exists beyond story. Not fixing the narrative but discovering what remains when the narrative releases its grip. Not becoming someone better but discovering what you are when you stop trying to be anything at all.

The ineffable holds them like water holds fish, like space holds stars, like consciousness holds everything that arises within it. And for this moment—eternal while it lasts—there is no therapy and no client, no guide and no guided, no problem and no solution.

There is simply this: being itself, knowing itself through these temporary forms called Evan and architect, playing at separation while never forgetting the unity that underlies all stories, all struggles, all swimming against currents that were only ever ourselves in motion.
