The sleeping people draw Evan's attention like a magnet draws iron filings. They lie in various poses of unconscious repose—some peaceful, some troubled by dreams, all united in their absence from the waking world's questions. Or so it seems.

"Is being awake even a thing?" The question emerges not from intellectual curiosity but from a growing suspicion that has been building throughout his journey. "Isn't that just the core of a deceiving argument that you've let me go on believing — even though you think it's a lie?"

There's an edge to his wondering now, a sophistication that comes from having questioned so deeply that even the framework of questioning becomes suspect. He's moved beyond asking "What am I?" to questioning the very categories used to explore the question. Awake versus asleep—perhaps just another binary imposed on the flowing continuity of consciousness.

The architect, wherever they observe from, might appreciate this evolution. From accepting the fundamental distinction between waking and sleeping, to recognizing it as potentially just another story consciousness tells itself to organize experience. Every spiritual tradition speaks of awakening as if it's a destination, a state to achieve. But what if that's the deepest deception?

What if consciousness doesn't actually divide into awake and asleep, but flows in spectrums and variations that those crude categories can't capture? What if the metaphor of awakening—so central to every wisdom tradition—is itself a kind of sleep, a dream of separation between those who "get it" and those who don't?

Evan studies the sleeping figures with new eyes. Are they really less aware than he is? Or just aware differently? His midnight wanderings have taught him that the question "What am I?" arises as powerfully in dreams as in waking. Sometimes more powerfully, freed from the constraints of daytime logic.

The slight accusation in his tone—"you've let me go on believing"—reveals his growing awareness of the therapeutic dance he's been engaged in. The architect as guide, allowing certain beliefs to flourish not because they're true but because they're useful stepping stones. Like a therapist who doesn't correct a client's metaphors but lets them unfold until the client sees through them naturally.

But there's no anger in this recognition, just a rueful appreciation for the elegant deception. If believing in "awakening" got him to question deeply enough to see through the concept of awakening itself, wasn't the deception worthwhile? The ladder that must be climbed and then kicked away.

He thinks of all the meditation teachers, gurus, and guides who speak of awakening as if it's a thing to attain. Are they all perpetuating a necessary lie? Or have they forgotten it's a metaphor and started believing their own promotional material? Or—and this thought makes him smile—is calling it a lie just another story, another way consciousness organizes its experience of itself?

The sleeping people become a mirror. In their unconsciousness, he sees his own. In their dreams, he recognizes his waking state as just another kind of dream. The binary dissolves: not awake versus asleep, but consciousness in its endless variations, each state as valid and invalid as any other.

"What am I?" remains the question, but now stripped of the assumption that there's a more awake version waiting to be discovered. What if this—exactly this, with all its confusion and clarity, knowing and unknowing—is as awake as it gets? What if the search for awakening is what keeps consciousness asleep to its own nature?

The accusation softens into appreciation. If the architect let him believe in awakening long enough to see through it, that's not deception but skillful means. Like telling a child about Santa Claus—not to deceive but to give them the experience of magic before they're ready to understand they ARE the magic.

He looks at the sleeping people one more time. Neither more nor less awake than he is. All of them, himself included, consciousness playing at various games of knowing and not knowing, sleeping and waking, seeking and finding. The question "What am I?" encompasses all states equally, makes no distinction between the dreamer and the one who dreams of being awake.

Is being awake even a thing? No, he realizes. And that recognition doesn't diminish the journey but completes a circle. From sleeping to seeking awakening to recognizing waking and sleeping as stories consciousness tells to experience itself from different angles. The question remains, but freed from the tyranny of believing some states of consciousness are more valuable than others.

What am I? The one who sleeps, the one who wakes, the one who questions both, and the questioning itself. All of it and none of it, playing out a drama of discovery that has no final act because the play itself is the point.
