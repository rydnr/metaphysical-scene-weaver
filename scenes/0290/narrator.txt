The corporate meditation room feels like an altar to productivity disguised as wellness. Evan sits among his colleagues in the monthly "Mindfulness for Performance" session, watching how differently the question lands in this context.

"Focus on your breath," the instructor intones with practiced serenity. "Let thoughts pass like clouds. Find your center."

Around him, executives and managers dutifully close their eyes, seeking ten minutes of peace to fuel fifty hours of frenzy. But Evan finds himself unable to play along with the commodification of contemplation. The question rises: What am I that can watch myself pretending to meditate while actually meditating on the pretense?

"If your mind wanders, gently bring it back to the breath," the instructor continues.

But Evan's mind doesn't wander—it wonders. What am I that breathes? What am I that can observe breathing? What am I that can get paid to sit in a room pretending consciousness is a productivity hack?

A notification vibrates someone's silenced phone. Half the room twitches with phantom urgency. The instructor maintains composure: "Remember, thoughts are just visitors. You don't have to invite them to stay."

This lands differently for Evan. The question "What am I?" has become his permanent resident, not visiting but dwelling, not passing through but making home. He's learned to live with this houseguest who rearranges all the furniture of certainty.

"Now, slowly open your eyes."

Evan opens his to find the instructor looking directly at him with an expression of... recognition? For a moment, beneath the corporate wellness veneer, he glimpses something else—another questioner perhaps, someone who knows the difference between performing meditation and being undone by it.

After the session, as others rush back to their urgencies, the instructor approaches. "You weren't following along," she observes. Not accusation but curiosity.

"I was following something," Evan replies. "Just not the script."

She glances around, ensures they're alone, then drops the professional mask. "I see it sometimes. People who've touched the real thing. The ones who can't pretend anymore that enlightenment is a stress-reduction technique."

"What am I?" Evan asks suddenly, not expecting answer but sharing the question like a secret handshake.

Her face transforms—recognition becoming conspiracy. "Oh, you're one of those. The ones the question has claimed. How long?"

"Months? Years? Forever? Time gets strange when you're being questioned by existence."

She laughs—real laughter, not the tinkling professional kind. "I teach this corporate mindfulness by day. But at night..." She pauses, seems to decide something. "There's a group. People who've been infected by the real questions. We meet Thursdays. Not to answer—answering is the disease. But to question together."

She hands him a card. Just an address, no name, no promise. "If you're tired of questioning alone."

Evan pockets the card, knowing he'll probably go, knowing it won't provide answers, knowing that's exactly why it might help. Community not of believers but of doubters, not of knowers but of wonderers.

"The funny thing," she says as they part, "is that this corporate meditation stuff actually works. Just not how they think. Get enough people sitting still, some percentage will accidentally stumble into the real thing. Touch the question that burns away everything else."

Back at his desk, Evan feels the card in his pocket like a small warm weight. An invitation not to solve the mystery but to share it. What am I? multiplied by however many seekers gather on Thursday nights, each one a variation on the theme, each questioning unique but united in the willingness to not know.

His computer screen awaits with its illusion of urgent emails. But for a moment longer, he sits with the question, feeling how it connects him to the instructor, to anyone who's ever paused in the middle of living to wonder what's doing the living.

What am I? The question that masquerades as seeking but secretly builds bridges between every consciousness brave enough to ask it. The question that turns corporate meditation rooms into accidental temples, that finds fellow travelers in the most unexpected places, that transforms isolation into invitation.

Thursday night. A room full of people claimed by the question. Evan already knows he'll be there, not seeking answers but seeking others who've learned to love the seeking itself. What am I? becomes What are we?—not answered but amplified, harmonized, made into chorus of wonder that might, just might, be the closest thing to resolution the question offers: not to be answered but to be asked together.
