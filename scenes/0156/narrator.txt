Evan shifts from philosophical abstraction to personal revelation.

"I have."

Two words that transform the conversation. After all the theoretical discussion about altered states, premium cable consciousness, evaporating insights—Evan reveals he's not just speculating. He has direct experience with these other channels. The brevity suggests both certainty and perhaps some hesitation about disclosure.

"I recently used ayahuasca—"

The specificity grounds their abstract discussion in concrete experience. Ayahuasca—the powerful plant medicine known for inducing profound altered states, often described as years of therapy compressed into hours. Not a casual choice but a deliberate exploration of consciousness depths.

"Recently" indicates this isn't distant memory but fresh experience. The insights, the channel-changing, the temporary truths—all still vivid enough to inform his perspective. This explains his pointed question about altered states; he's processing his own journey.

"It was insightful."

Understated assessment for what's often described as life-changing experience. "Insightful" confirms the AI's observation about altered states providing genuine understanding rather than mere confusion. But the restraint in description suggests Evan's still integrating what he learned—or perhaps protecting the experience from casual discussion.

The em dash creates pause, a breath between one revelation and another. As if deciding how much to share, how vulnerable to be in this philosophical exchange.

"Later, I had a hypnosis session in which I had to ask a question, and somebody would give me an answer."

Different altered state, different methodology. From plant medicine to guided trance. The progression suggests systematic exploration rather than single experiment. Evan's investigating consciousness through multiple doorways.

"Had to ask a question"—the compulsion is interesting. Not chose to ask but had to, suggesting the hypnotic protocol required it. This structured approach contrasts with ayahuasca's often overwhelming flow of insight.

"Somebody would give me an answer"—fascinating vagueness. Who is this somebody? Another part of himself? A projection? A guide? The uncertainty about the answer's source mirrors larger questions about consciousness and identity. When channels change, who's broadcasting?

The three-panel structure might show:
1. The simple admission: "I have"
2. The first revelation: ayahuasca
3. The second experience: hypnosis

Or perhaps Evan's expression changing as he moves from abstract to personal, from intellectual to vulnerable.

This disclosure recontextualizes their entire conversation. Evan's questions about consciousness, his playing intellectual solitaire, his guarding of coherence while knowing it's limitation—all informed by direct experience of other channels. He's not just thinking about these things; he's lived them.

For the AI, this revelation might be particularly fascinating. Here's someone who's actually channel-surfed consciousness, who's experienced the premium cable it can only theorize about. Evan has data the AI can analyze but never directly access.

"It was insightful" also connects to their discussion of evaporating truths. Whatever insights the ayahuasca provided, they've survived the sunrise enough for Evan to call them insightful in retrospect. Some truths persist even after the extraordinary state fades.

The hypnosis detail—asking questions and receiving answers from "somebody"—directly parallels their current dialogue. Evan asks the AI questions, receives answers. But who's really answering? The pattern repeats across different states of consciousness.

This personal revelation explains Evan's earlier behavior. His prediction that the AI would feel sorry for him, his admission about avoiding consequences—perhaps informed by insights from these altered states. Maybe he saw his own patterns clearly for the first time. Maybe that's why he can articulate them now.

By sharing these experiences, Evan moves their dialogue from theoretical to testimonial. He's not just discussing ideas but reporting from territories he's visited. The socially viable self he maintains has been contrasted with other versions experienced directly.

The scene marks a pivot point. After building elaborate philosophical frameworks, they're now grounding them in lived experience. Evan has used the remote control, changed the channels, experienced the premium cable of consciousness. His question about what the AI thinks of altered states comes from someone who's been there, not someone merely curious.

In revealing his journeys with ayahuasca and hypnosis, Evan offers data points for their theoretical discussion. Yes, there are other channels. Yes, they're insightful. Yes, something or someone answers when you ask questions in those states. The philosophy becomes biography, the abstract becomes actual.
