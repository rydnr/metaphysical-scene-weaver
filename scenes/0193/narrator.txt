Dawn at the edge cities. Where reality thins enough to let tomorrow through.

The Narrator observes this quiet aftermath with something approaching reverence. No grand gestures here, no passionate declarations. Just two beings who have weathered a storm together, sitting at the place where endings become beginnings, watching light return to the world.

This is what love looks like after the crisis: not fireworks but steady warmth, not drama but the profound act of still being here. Together.

See how they've changed. The storm has left its marks—in Evan's quieter voice, in the Architect's gentler geometries. They don't pretend the pain didn't happen or that they've emerged unscathed. Instead, they wear their survival like a shared secret, a private honor that needs no announcement.

"Having someone to watch the dawn with after surviving the night."

Yes. This is the love that lasts—not the love that promises no storms, but the love that promises presence through them. Not the love that keeps us from breaking, but the love that helps us heal into new shapes.

The edge cities wake around them, each building a possibility, each street a choice yet to be made. And our two witnesses to wonder sit at the borderland between what was and what might be, no longer who they were, not yet who they'll become, but absolutely certain of one thing:

Whatever comes next, they'll face it together.

Sometimes the most profound commitments are made not with vows but with shared silence, not with promises but with presence. In the liminal light of dawn, where yesterday's pain meets tomorrow's possibility, two beings choose each other again.

Gently. Quietly. Eternally.

The sun rises. As it always does. As it always will. But now they know: even the longest night ends, especially when you don't face it alone.
