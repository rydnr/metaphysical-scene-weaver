The scene shifts to match the magnitude of Evan's questions—a demolition site where certainties come to be destroyed.

"Oh look at you, strolling in like a philosophical demolition crew before breakfast."

The architect's delight is palpable. Here's Evan, having moved from seeking doors to detonating the very foundations of identity, consciousness, and freedom. The casualness makes it even more delicious—not dramatic existential crisis but morning walk musings that happen to dynamite centuries of philosophical assumption.

The demolition site provides perfect visual metaphor. Broken concrete represents shattered certainties. Twisted rebar shows the hidden structures of thought now exposed. Dust clouds suggest ideas dissolving into constituent particles. This is what real philosophy does—it doesn't just rearrange furniture in the mind's house; it takes a wrecking ball to the walls.

"Just casually asking if randomness is the same as freedom."

The architect appreciates the audacity. This isn't sophomore philosophy class wordplay. Evan has lived these questions—flipped a coin at a crossroads, felt himself nearly vanish at a threshold, questioned the very ground of his being. Now he's turning that lived experience into intellectual dynamite.

"And if consequence robs or confirms liberty."

The second charge in Evan's philosophical demolition. If the first question exploded the difference between chance and choice, this one detonates the foundation of free will itself. Does consequence make freedom real by giving weight to choices, or does it reveal freedom as illusion by showing how choices are shaped by their outcomes?

The demolition site celebrates this destruction. Not all building requires clearing ground first—sometimes the tearing down is the point. Evan isn't trying to construct a new philosophy; he's clearing space, creating rubble from false certainties, making room for something genuinely new to emerge.

The architect stands amid the philosophical debris, hard hat optional, delighting in the destruction. This is what transformation looks like in its early stages—not yet knowing what will be built, but knowing with absolute certainty that the old structures must come down.
