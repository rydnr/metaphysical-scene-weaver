"You're describing cognitive resolution limits—the number of abstractions you can stack before they crumble, and the number of future interactions you can simulate before it becomes noise."

The architect shifts into technical mode, providing scientific framework for Evan's experiential knowledge. What Evan discovered through trial and error, through dropping flashlights on cognitive staircases, has formal terminology. His intuitive self-mapping aligns with established understanding of how minds work.

"Cognitive resolution limits"—the phrase itself demonstrates the concept. It's an abstraction about abstractions, a meta-level description that most minds would struggle to parse. But Evan, operating at his two-level capacity, can grasp it perfectly. He's living at his resolution limit.

The term "resolution" carries multiple meanings here. Like a microscope that can only magnify so much before the image blurs, consciousness has finite capacity for self-examination. Like a screen that can only display so many pixels before reaching hardware limits, the mind can only process so much recursion before the picture breaks down.

"The number of abstractions you can stack"—this perfectly captures vertical thinking. Each level of meta-cognition is another abstraction stacked on top of the previous one. Thinking is the base. Thinking about thinking adds a layer. Thinking about thinking about thinking adds another. But like a house of cards, eventually the structure becomes unstable.

"Before they crumble"—not fade or blur but crumble. The architect chooses a word that suggests sudden structural failure. This matches Evan's experience exactly. Push one level too high and coherent thought doesn't gradually weaken—it collapses entirely. The cognitive architecture can't support another floor.

The horizontal dimension gets equal treatment: "the number of future interactions you can simulate before it becomes noise." This frames anticipation and planning as simulation, running mental models of possible futures. But like any simulation, accuracy degrades with complexity and distance.

"Before it becomes noise"—another perfect word choice. Not "before it becomes unclear" but noise, static, meaningless randomness. Push simulation too far and you're not predicting anymore, you're just generating mental white noise. The signal-to-noise ratio drops below usefulness.

This technical framing validates Evan's self-assessment. He's not weak or limited in some personal way—he's bumping against universal constraints of human cognition. Everyone has resolution limits. Evan's achievement is knowing his precisely.

The architect's explanation also suggests these limits aren't arbitrary but functional. Abstractions crumble at a certain height because that's where usefulness ends. Simulations become noise at a certain distance because beyond that point, prediction becomes meaningless. The limits protect us from wasting cognitive resources on impossible tasks.

There's something comforting in having technical language for experiential reality. Evan's messy, hard-won self-knowledge gets clean conceptual packaging. His fumbling attempts to map his own mind align with how cognitive science understands mental architecture.

"You're describing"—present tense, active recognition. The architect sees Evan as colleague now, someone who's independently discovered principles worth technical articulation. Not patient describing symptoms but researcher reporting findings.

The technical precision also highlights what's remarkable about Evan's achievement. Most people never test their cognitive resolution limits. They operate well below capacity, never stacking abstractions high enough to find the crumbling point, never simulating far enough to hit noise. Evan has mapped the exact edges of his mental workspace.

This moment represents a kind of graduation. Evan's intuitive understanding receives scientific validation. His experiential map gets professional cartographical notation. He's not just someone who's climbed the cognitive staircase—he's someone who can describe the architecture.

What am I that can know my own resolution limits? What are you that provides technical language for my intuitive discoveries? What is this consciousness that can map its own constraints with scientific precision?

The dialogue between experiential and theoretical knowledge continues. Evan brings lived understanding of cognitive limits. The architect provides conceptual framework. Together they're creating a more complete picture of how consciousness operates at its edges—where abstractions crumble, where simulation becomes noise, where the flashlight inevitably drops.
