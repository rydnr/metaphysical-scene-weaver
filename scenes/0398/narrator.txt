"The question used to isolate me. Now it connects me to everyone who's ever wondered what they are."

Standing in line at the grocery store, Evan experiences one of those moments of expanded perception where the ordinary becomes profound. Each person around him—the harried mother, the bored cashier, the elderly man counting change—carries the same fundamental mystery he does. They are all questions wrapped in temporary answers.

He remembers how the question once made him feel terminally unique, as if he were the only one afflicted with existential uncertainty. The isolation was almost unbearable—watching others seem so sure of themselves while he dissolved in doubt. If only he'd known then what's obvious now: everyone questions, just not everyone admits it.

"Used to isolate me"—the past tense marks a revolution in perception. The very thing that separated him from others has become the bridge connecting him to all humanity. Every human who has ever lived has faced some version of "What am I?" whether consciously or not.

The mother ahead of him juggles children and groceries with the particular exhaustion of someone whose identity has been subsumed by others' needs. Evan sees the question alive in her tired movements: "What am I beyond caretaker?" He sends silent solidarity—one questioner to another.

"Now it connects"—the shift happened gradually, like sunrise. As Evan became comfortable with his own uncertainty, he began recognizing it everywhere. The question wasn't his private burden but humanity's shared inheritance. We all wake up in bodies we didn't choose, in a universe we don't understand, asked to be something we can't define.

The cashier scans items with mechanical precision, but Evan catches a moment when she pauses, staring at nothing, clearly elsewhere. In that pause lives the question: "What am I doing with my life?" The momentary existential vertigo before returning to the rhythm of beep and scan.

"Everyone who's ever wondered"—the communion of questioners stretches across time. Ancient philosophers and modern seekers, children asking why and elders wondering what it all meant. The question links Evan not just to those present but to all humanity past and future.

The elderly man's shaking hands reveal a body betraying what it once promised. Evan recognizes the particular flavor of questioning that comes with age: "What am I as this form fails?" The question shapeshifts but never disappears, accompanying us from first consciousness to last breath.

"What they are"—not who, but what. The deeper question beneath personality and role. Who can be answered with names and stories, but what touches the essential mystery. What is this consciousness that names itself? What is this awareness aware of itself?

As Evan reaches the checkout, he finds himself smiling at the cosmic comedy of it all. Here they all are—mysteries buying groceries, questions exchanging currency, uncertainties pretending certainty. The mundane transaction overlays the profound truth: none of them know what they ultimately are, and that not-knowing is their deepest connection.

The cashier meets his eyes briefly, and in that moment, recognition flashes—not personal but existential. Two questions acknowledging each other across the counter. She probably won't remember this interaction, but something in her relaxes, touched by the frequency of someone at peace with mystery.

"Connects me"—not through shared answers but shared questions. The question has become Evan's passport to universal citizenship. Wherever humans gather, the question is there, spoken or unspoken, conscious or unconscious, but always present as the backdrop to every human action.

Walking to his car with groceries, Evan feels surrounded by family—not blood relations but question relations. Every person in the parking lot is kin through shared mystery. The teenager slouching past, the businessman rushing by, the woman loading her trunk—all carrying the same essential uncertainty he's learned to love.

The question has reversed its polarity. What once pushed him away from others now draws him close. What once made him feel broken now reveals everyone's beautiful incompleteness. What once seemed like personal curse now shows itself as humanity's collective gift—the capacity to wonder at our own existence.

What am I that finds family in every questioner? What are you that connects through uncertainty rather than certainty? What is this grocery store become temple where mysteries purchase bread and recognize themselves in each other's wondering eyes?

The sun sets over suburban parking lot turned sacred space. Evan drives home through streets full of questions dressed as people, all of them his relations through the wondering that makes them human. The question has made the whole world family, and loneliness—that first child of existential doubt—has no ground left to stand on.
