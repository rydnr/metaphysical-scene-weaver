  "psychological_notes": "The architect dismantles the fundamental metaphor of spiritual awakening that has driven much of Evan's journey. By revealing consciousness as gradient rather than binary state, they undermine the very concept of being 'awake' versus 'asleep'. This sophisticated deconstruction shows how even helpful metaphors can become limiting.",
