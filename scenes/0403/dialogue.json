The red is the urgency of asking, the blue is the depth of not knowing, the yellow is the joy of dancing with mystery. *adding white* And this... this is the silence where all colors merge. *contemplating* 'What am I?' can't be answered in words, but it can be painted, sung, danced, lived. *final stroke* Every creative act is the question exploring its own nature.",
