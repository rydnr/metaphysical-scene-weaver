"The therapy group meets in the spiral garden. 'We're not here to answer your questions,' the facilitator says, 'but to help you fall in love with them.'"

The Questions Quarter has spawned new forms of therapeutic practice. Dr. Rosa Martinez, trained in traditional psychology but transformed by her own questioning journey, leads what she calls "Uncertainty Therapy"—helping those who struggle not with mental illness but with existential wellness.

Today's group includes a CEO experiencing identity crisis post-retirement, a new mother wondering who she is beyond caregiver, a teenager rejecting all labels, and surprisingly, Marcus Sterling—former leader of the Certainty Movement, now seeking what he once opposed.

"Fall in love with them"—Dr. Martinez learned this approach from studying Evan's journals and Maya's teaching methods. Traditional therapy often aims to resolve uncertainty. Her practice celebrates it, helps clients develop affectionate relationship with their questions.

The spiral garden serves as natural therapeutic space. Unlike clinical offices that suggest problems needing solutions, the garden normalizes questioning. Clients walk as they talk, movement preventing the stuck feeling that often accompanies identity exploration.

"I spent forty years being 'successful businessman,'" the retired CEO shares. "Now that identity is gone and I'm terrified of the emptiness." Dr. Martinez guides gently: "What if the emptiness is spaciousness? Room for something new to emerge?"

Marcus Sterling sits quietly, his presence causing initial tension. Last year he led protests here. Now he walks the same paths seeking what he doesn't yet understand. "I was so angry at uncertainty," he finally speaks. "But the certainty I demanded was killing me."

"We're not here to answer"—this disclaimer relieves visible pressure from the group. The new mother exhales deeply. "Thank god. I'm so tired of people telling me who I should be." The teenager nods vigorously, finding unexpected ally in someone decades older.

The therapy involves exercises developed from contemplative traditions and modern psychology. Walking meditation on the spiral. Partner work where one person asks "What are you?" repeatedly while the other responds differently each time. Journaling prompts that celebrate rather than solve identity questions.

"Your questions"—the possessive pronoun matters. Dr. Martinez helps each person develop personal relationship with their uncertainty. The CEO's "What am I without my career?" differs from the mother's "What am I beyond my roles?" yet both are variations on the eternal theme.

Marcus shares his story: years of clinging to fixed identity—white, male, leader—feeling increasingly brittle as world changed around him. The Certainty Movement gave him purpose, enemies, simple answers. "But at night, the questions came anyway. I was fighting myself."

The group receives him with compassion that brings tears. Here, former enemies of uncertainty are welcomed as fellow travelers. Dr. Martinez has learned that resistance often signals readiness—the psyche preparing for transformation it simultaneously fears.

"Love"—not romantic but appreciative, the way one might love difficult art that reveals new meanings over time. The teenager begins to see how his rejection of labels is itself profound question. The mother realizes her identity crisis is also identity opportunity.

They practice "question gratitude"—naming what their uncertainty has taught them. The CEO discovers his emptiness revealed how over-identified he'd been with external role. Marcus admits his protests connected him to the question more deeply than ignoring it would have.

The session includes creative expression. They're given art supplies to represent their questions visually. The mother creates nursing madonna dissolving into stars. The teenager draws figure made entirely of question marks. Marcus, surprisingly, paints a door opening onto light.

"Help you fall in love"—by session's end, the transformation is visible. Not resolution but softening. The CEO speaks of excitement alongside fear. The mother mentions feeling "pregnant with possibility." Even Marcus admits to strange relief in surrendering certainty.

Dr. Martinez closes with invitation to see their questions as lifelong companions rather than temporary afflictions. "Some relationships are meant to last," she says. "Your relationship with 'What am I?' might be the most enduring one you'll ever have."

They leave through different gates, but all transformed. The garden holds their questions like therapist who never rushes toward premature closure. Some will return next week, others will find their own ways of walking with uncertainty.

What am I that heals through questioning rather than answering? What are they that transform by embracing rather than solving their mysteries? What is this therapy that prescribes wonder as medicine?

Evening light bathes the garden in gold. Dr. Martinez walks alone now, her own questions keeping her company. Tomorrow new groups will come—executives, artists, parents, rebels—all seeking not to eliminate their questions but to dance with them. The therapy of uncertainty continues, gentle as the spiral path, transformative as accepting that some questions are too beautiful to answer.
