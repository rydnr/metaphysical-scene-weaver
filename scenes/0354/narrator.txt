"Sometimes I forget I ever struggled with it. Then I remember, and the remembering is sweet."

Sitting in his favorite café, Evan experiences one of those moments of temporal vertigo where past and present collapse into each other. He's stirring coffee, mind elsewhere, when suddenly he's both here and there—the person who sits comfortably with uncertainty and the person who was once destroyed by it.

The sweetness isn't schadenfreude toward his past self but deep appreciation for the journey. Like a athlete remembering the pain of training after winning the race, the memory of struggle adds dimension to current ease. Without the darkness, how would he recognize the light?

"Sometimes I forget"—this forgetting is its own gift. To be so integrated with the question that it no longer registers as remarkable. To have normalized what once felt impossible. The question has become like breathing—essential, continuous, unnoticed until attention turns to it.

The café buzzes with afternoon energy, and Evan sees his past self in every corner. That woman frantically typing—he recognizes the desperate attempt to think your way out of existential crisis. That man staring into space—the paralysis of overwhelming uncertainty. They're all him, at different stages of the spiral.

"I ever struggled"—past tense marking profound distance traveled. The struggle was real, necessary, honorable. But it's over, not because the question was answered but because the relationship transformed. Like learning to swim, what once was survival became grace.

The coffee swirls in patterns that suggest spirals, and Evan smiles at how everything has become teaching. The question trained his perception to see patterns, depth, meaning in the ordinary. Even stirring coffee becomes meditation on identity's fluid nature.

"Then I remember"—memory arising not as burden but as teacher. Each recollection of past anguish increases gratitude for present peace. The remembering isn't nostalgic or regretful but instructive, showing how far consciousness can travel when it stops resisting its own nature.

He thinks of specific moments: the night he couldn't sleep, convinced he was losing his mind. The therapy session where he sobbed, begging for answers. The morning he first walked the spiral, desperate for anything that might help. Each memory glows with the poignancy of necessary suffering.

"The remembering is sweet"—not the suffering itself but the remembering. Sweet like honey made from bitter flowers, transformation complete. The past pain has fermented into present wisdom. What hurt then nourishes now.

A young person enters the café with the particular energy of existential crisis—rushed movements, darting eyes, the physical manifestation of a mind that can't rest. Evan recognizes every gesture. Part of him wants to say "It gets better," but he knows that wouldn't help. The struggle can't be skipped.

Instead, he simply holds space, the way the architect held space for him. His presence in the café, calm with uncertainty, broadcasts a frequency that says transformation is possible. Not through words but through being, he offers what was offered to him—living proof that the question doesn't kill you.

"Sweet"—the word carries multiple meanings. Sweet as in pleasant, but also sweet as in precious, dear, valuable. The remembering connects him to humanity's universal struggle with self-knowledge. His personal journey joins the larger human story.

The coffee finished, Evan sits with the empty cup, appreciating the metaphor. The vessel that held the bitter brew now holds only memory of warmth. The question that held anguish now holds only appreciation for the journey. Empty and full simultaneously.

Sometimes he forgets the years of struggle, living so naturally with uncertainty that it seems he was always this way. Then something—a gesture, a phrase, a quality of light—triggers memory, and he's flooded with compassionate recognition of the distance traveled.

The sweetness includes everyone still struggling. Each person wrestling with "What am I?" is him, earlier in the spiral. Their pain is real, their confusion valid, their desperate seeking necessary. The sweetness of remembering includes holding space for their journey.

What am I that forgets and remembers? What are you that transforms bitter into sweet? What is this consciousness that makes medicine from its own confusion?

The café continues its afternoon rhythm. Evan sits among the questioners, some aware of their questioning, others not yet. He's a marker on the path, showing by example that survival is possible, that struggle ends not in answer but in transformation, that the remembering can be sweet.

The empty coffee cup holds space like the question holds space—defined by what it doesn't contain as much as what it does. The sweetness lingers, not just on tongue but in consciousness, the aftertaste of journey survived and appreciated.
