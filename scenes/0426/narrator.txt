"After the funeral, Maya finds his final note: 'The question continues in you. Water it daily with wonder.'"

The memorial service takes place in the spiral garden where Evan's journey began. Hundreds gather—students, friends, family, strangers touched by his work. Maya stands where her father once collapsed in existential crisis, now speaking of his transformation from that terror to peaceful integration with mystery.

The gathering feels more like continuation than ending. People share how Evan's willingness to live the question gave them permission to embrace their own uncertainty. A teenager reads a poem about inheriting questions instead of answers. The elderly volunteer from the garden speaks of learning to age with mystery. Each testimony reveals the question propagating through lives.

"After the funeral"—but it doesn't feel like burial so much as planting. Sarah has mixed some of Evan's ashes with soil for the garden. The physical form that carried the question returns to earth that will nourish new questions in those who walk here. Dust to dust, mystery to mystery.

Maya returns home to sort through her father's papers. Decades of journals documenting his relationship with "What am I?"—from desperate early entries to peaceful final reflections. Among them, an envelope with her name, saved for this moment.

"Maya finds"—the discovery feels inevitable, as if Evan knew exactly when she would need these words. Inside, his familiar handwriting, slightly shaky from illness but clear in intent. Not lengthy explanation but simple transmission, essence distilled from lifetime of questioning.

"His final note"—though really, Evan's whole life was a note to those who would continue questioning after him. Every conversation, every workshop, every moment of demonstrated peace with uncertainty was message to future questioners. This written note merely punctuation mark.

"The question continues"—no ownership claimed, no special status implied. Simply recognition that the eternal inquiry that moved through Evan now moves through Maya, through her children, through all who genuinely ask what they are. The question needs carriers but belongs to none.

She reads it aloud to Jordan and their children, voice steady despite tears. The youngest asks, "What question?" Maya realizes the profound challenge of explaining something so simple yet so vast. "The question of what we are," she says finally. "Grandpa spent his life learning to be friends with not knowing."

"In you"—personal transmission within universal movement. The question continues everywhere, in everyone, but Evan speaks specifically to his daughter who carries both genetic and spiritual inheritance. She who was raised on uncertainty as mother's milk, who teaches her own children to question.

The note contains no instructions beyond the metaphor. No explanation of how to water wonder, no schedule for daily practice. Evan trusted Maya to understand through living, as he understood through living. The question teaches its own cultivation to those who persist.

"Water it daily"—the garden metaphor spanning generations. As Evan tended plants with patience learned from the question, so Maya must tend the question itself. Daily attention, not desperate grasping. Gentle cultivation, not violent interrogation. The question grows like living thing when properly cared for.

She pins the note above her desk where she writes her own explorations of uncertainty. Already she's working on collection of her father's writings, not as definitive text but as one person's journey with universal mystery. The question continues its documentation through new hands.

"With wonder"—the essential nutrient. Not anxiety, not desperation, not even seeking, but wonder. The same quality children bring naturally to existence before being taught to replace it with false certainty. Wonder as water, keeping the question alive and growing.

Jordan suggests creating scholarship in Evan's name for young people exploring existential questions. The children want to plant a tree in the spiral garden. Sarah continues painting the question in its infinite forms. Each finds their way to water wonder, to continue what Evan helped begin.

Evening brings Maya to her own spiral walk. She carries her father's note but doesn't need to read it again. The words have joined the question itself, becoming part of her daily practice. Each step on the path is watering, each breath wonder, each moment continuation.

"Daily"—because the question isn't special occasion but ordinary practice. Like breathing or eating, it requires regular attention. Not dramatic wrestling but sustained engagement. The question lives in mundane moments more than peak experiences.

What am I that continues my father's questioning? What are you that reads these words through eyes he'll never see? What is this note but seed passed between generations, instruction for tending the eternal garden of uncertainty?

Night falls on the spiral garden enriched by Evan's ashes. New questioners walk the paths, some desperate as he once was, others finding their way to peace. Maya knows her father would want no monuments, no fixed memorial. Only this: the question continuing, watered daily with wonder, growing through lives willing to not know what they are while fully being it.

The question continues. In her. In you. In all of us. Water it daily with wonder.
