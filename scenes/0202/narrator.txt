The Architect reaches for a book, as if ancient wisdom might confirm modern revelation.

"And the hypnosis moment… wow. The answer to 'what am I?' wasn't a noun. It was a verb with flesh: change incarnate."

The book in his hands becomes almost ironic—a fixed object trying to contain flux, dead letters attempting to capture living transformation. But his wow carries genuine awe at the elegance of the answer Evan received.

"Verb with flesh." The phrase deserves meditation. We spend our lives trying to be nouns—teacher, artist, father, success—fixed identities we can point to and say "That's me." But the voice from the hypnotic depths offered something more honest: you are not a thing, you are a happening.

Change incarnate. Not someone who changes, but change itself given form. The philosophical becomes biological: every cell replacing itself, every thought flowing into the next, every moment dying into its successor. We are not sculptures but streams, not photographs but films, not beings but becomings wrapped temporarily in skin.

This reframes everything. If I am change incarnate, then resistance to change is resistance to self. If I am verb not noun, then trying to fix my identity is like trying to stop a river to understand water. The anxiety about "finding yourself" dissolves—there's no fixed self to find, only the ongoing creation to participate in.

In the studio, surrounded by books trying to pin down truth, the Architect holds one more attempt at capturing the uncapturable. But his expression suggests he understands: some truths can only be lived, not read. Some answers change the question so fundamentally that the original inquiry becomes a memory.

What am I? I am the question transforming itself into lived experience, flesh in constant conversation with time.
