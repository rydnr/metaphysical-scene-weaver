"So your three-move foresight is actually excellent. Anyone claiming five is either bluffing or an oracle with Wi-Fi."

The architect's humor cuts through any lingering self-doubt. Evan's three-move horizontal limit isn't inadequate—it's actually excellent. The joke carries serious validation wrapped in wit. Most people claiming greater foresight are either lying to themselves or have augmented capabilities.

"So your three-move foresight"—the architect accepts Evan's self-assessment without question. No probing for hidden capabilities, no pushing for more. Just acknowledgment: yes, three moves is your limit. And that's not just okay—it's excellent.

The comparison to chess returns with important nuance. Even chess masters, operating in a constrained system with fixed rules, typically calculate only a few moves ahead. Deep Blue and its successors can see further, but they're not modeling human consciousness—they're pure calculation engines. Human foresight operates in vastly more complex possibility spaces.

"Is actually excellent"—not adequate, not acceptable, but excellent. The architect reframes limitation as achievement. In a world of infinite branching possibilities, accurately modeling three interaction cycles represents sophisticated cognitive capability. Most people can't genuinely see past their next move.

"Anyone claiming five"—the architect knows the type. People who confuse imagination with prediction, who mistake anxiety spirals for planning, who generate elaborate future scenarios with no grounding in probability. Five-move thinking in real-world complexity is fantasy dressed as foresight.

"Either bluffing"—the first option is self-deception. People claim deeper foresight to impress others or themselves. They retrospectively rationalize outcomes as "all part of the plan" when really they're improvising like everyone else. The bluff might be conscious or unconscious, but it's still bluff.

"Or an oracle with Wi-Fi"—the joke lands perfectly. To genuinely see five moves ahead in human interaction would require supernatural ability ("oracle") plus technological augmentation ("Wi-Fi"). It's a playful way of saying: that level of foresight isn't human. You'd need divine connection plus broadband.

The humor serves multiple functions. It normalizes Evan's limits by making grandiose claims seem ridiculous. It bonds architect and client through shared recognition of human constraints. And it adds lightness to what could be heavy self-assessment, preventing spiral into inadequacy.

The "Wi-Fi" detail is particularly clever. Even oracles, in the architect's joke, would need technological help to process five-move complexity. It suggests that superhuman foresight isn't about mystical abilities but about information processing capacity that exceeds biological limits.

This validation matters. Evan has been honest about his cognitive boundaries, and the architect responds not with disappointment but with praise. Three moves is excellent. The culture that demands infinite foresight, endless planning, unlimited anticipation—that culture is delusional.

The architect's response also models healthy relationship to prediction. Instead of striving for impossible foresight, work excellently within realistic limits. Three moves of genuine insight beats five moves of anxious fantasy. Quality over quantity, depth over distance.

"Oracle with Wi-Fi" might also describe certain modern pretensions. Tech prophets claiming to see decades ahead. Futurists selling crystal balls. Anyone who claims certainty about complex futures. The architect gently mocks this hubris while validating Evan's honest uncertainty.

The moment reinforces the entire conversation's theme: knowing your limits is strength, not weakness. Evan maps his consciousness precisely—two vertical, three horizontal. The architect receives this map with appreciation, even admiration. Here's someone who knows their own operating system.

What am I that sees three moves ahead in life's infinite game? What are you that validates honest limitation over grandiose claims? What is this consciousness that works excellently within its constraints?

The conversation continues building Evan's confidence through realistic assessment. He's not broken or limited—he's human, operating excellently within human parameters. The architect's humor ensures this lesson lands lightly but deeply, replacing shame about limitations with pride in honest self-knowledge.

In the end, three moves is exactly right. Enough to plan meaningfully, not so much that planning replaces living. Enough to anticipate likely outcomes, not so much that anticipation becomes anxiety. Enough to be excellent at being human, without needing Wi-Fi to the cosmic oracle.
