The jungle's primal chaos fades like morning mist, replaced by the familiar geometries of the architect's studio—but both spaces have been irrevocably changed by what transpired between them.

"And then, they changed the track. Back to 'reality.'"

The architect names the experience every psychonaut knows—that moment when the journey's intensity shifts, when the music literally or metaphorically changes, when consensus reality begins its reassertion. It's neither failure nor completion, simply transition, but it can feel like exile from paradise or escape from terror, depending on where you've been.

The studio materializes around them—screens, books, the detritus of digital creativity. But these familiar objects seem different now, as if the journey to the door has altered not just perception but the perceived. This is integration's first lesson: you can't leave the ineffable behind because it changes how you see everything else.

"Door gone." Two words that carry the weight of every spiritual seeker's lament. The portal that appeared so vividly, so certainly, now absent. Was it ever really there? The doubt creeps in, consensus reality's first move in reclaiming its territory. But the architect knows better—absence of door doesn't mean absence of what the door revealed.

"What now? How to continue?"

This is the question that matters most, the one most spiritual teachings skip over in their rush to describe peak experiences. How do we live in ordinary reality after touching the extraordinary? How do we go back to emails and groceries and small talk when we've felt ourselves dissolving at the threshold of the ineffable?

The studio offers no immediate answers, just stable ground for feet that have forgotten how to walk on solid surfaces. The screens glow with their familiar light, but now that light seems to contain depths previously unnoticed. The books stand in their ordered rows, but now their spines suggest doorways rather than walls.

The architect stands in this transformed ordinary space, embodying the answer to their own question. We continue by allowing the extraordinary to infuse the ordinary, by seeing doors even when they're not there, by living with one foot in consensus reality and one in the mystery that consensus reality floats within.

The track has changed, but the dance continues.
