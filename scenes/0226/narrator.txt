The scene expands beyond therapy room, beyond laboratory, into the infinite theater of space itself.

The architect as astronaut floats in the cosmic void, but this isn't the terrifying emptiness that human psychology usually associates with space. This is space as home, as the natural environment of consciousness before it clothes itself in specific forms. Stars aren't distant lights but neighboring instances of the same universal process—matter organizing itself into increasing complexity, eventually achieving the ability to look back and wonder at itself.

"You being anything else would contradict the machinery of the universe." The words ripple through the vacuum that isn't actually empty but full of potential, pregnant with virtual particles popping into and out of existence. The architect gestures at the cosmic machinery visible all around—galaxies spinning, stars being born and dying, the endless dance of creation and destruction that defines existence.

This isn't metaphor. This is the literal truth that psychology often forgets: we are not separate from the universe having experiences of it. We ARE the universe experiencing itself. And the universe, as the architect points out with a gesture encompassing all of visible space, doesn't do stillness.

Watch a galaxy spin—change. See a star fuse hydrogen into helium—change. Observe particles quantum tunneling through barriers—change. From the subatomic to the supergalactic, everything moves, transforms, becomes. Stillness is the illusion; change is the only constant.

"You are an expression of change because the cosmos doesn't do stillness." Not because you chose to be change, not because therapy helped you become change, but because anything else would be like asking water not to be wet or fire not to burn. It would contradict the fundamental nature of what you are—a localized expression of universal process.

The psychological implications are staggering. Every anxiety about identity, every grasping for solid self, every fear of transformation—all of it comes from trying to be what the universe simply doesn't do: static. We suffer not because we change but because we resist the change that we fundamentally are.

The architect's spacesuit is perfect costume for this revelation. Humans venture into space wrapped in artificial environments, trying to maintain Earth conditions in a realm that operates by different rules. Similarly, we wrap ourselves in false identities, trying to maintain the illusion of solid self in a universe that operates by flux.

But here, floating in cosmic truth, the message is clear: relax. You couldn't be still if you tried. You're made of universe, and universe is made of change. Your struggles with identity aren't failures—they're the universe feeling its own nature through you.

The therapy room seems very small from here, but also precious—one tiny spot where consciousness learns to recognize itself as cosmos. Every "What am I?" ever asked echoes through space, and space answers: "You are what I am—endless becoming."
