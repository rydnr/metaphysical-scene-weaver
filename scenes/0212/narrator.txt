Memory has its own wisdom, releasing what we're ready to hear when we're ready to hear it.

"I forgot to mention one statement he made after the 'you're change incarnate' part. He paused for a moment."

The confession comes wrapped in apparent casualness, but the body language tells a different story. This isn't forgetting in the usual sense—it's the psyche's careful curation of revelation, doling out truth in digestible portions. Some insights are too large to swallow whole.

Notice what Evan remembers: not just the forgotten statement, but the pause itself. "He paused for a moment." In the economy of mystical experience, pauses are never empty. They're pregnant with meaning, heavy with what's about to emerge. The pause becomes part of the message, the silence before the storm of truth.

That this emerges now, after all the other revelations have been shared and processed, suggests perfect psychological timing. The ego-teenager has been acknowledged, the body's wisdom honored, the need for healing over protection established. Now, with defenses lowered and trust established, what was hidden can emerge.

The therapy room holds this confession gently. Some truths need to orbit us before landing, need to be "forgotten" until we're strong enough to remember. What seemed like omission was actually the psyche's kindness, protecting us from too much too soon.

In therapeutic space, these "forgotten" pieces often carry the most charge. They're the truths we couldn't quite face, the insights that needed to wait in the wings until the stage was properly set. The pause after "change incarnate"—what wisdom waited in that silence? What truth needed that moment of gathering before it could speak?

Evan leans forward now, ready to complete the revelation. The forgotten is about to be remembered. The pause is about to give birth to words.
