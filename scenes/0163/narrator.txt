In the square where certainty once held solemn ceremonies, a different kind of gathering has emerged - a perpetual festival celebrating the joy of not knowing.

The transformation is complete. Where once seekers gathered with furrowed brows and heavy hearts, trying to solve the riddle of self, now they dance with light steps and bright eyes, each carrying their uncertainty like a glowing lantern. Festiva, the master of these mysteries, orchestrates not a search for answers but a celebration of questions.

"I used to think finding myself meant solving 'What am I?'" Evan announces to the assembled celebrants, and their words spark recognition like fireworks. Around them, others who've made the same journey nod and raise their glasses - not in commiseration but in joy.

This is what the festival celebrates: the moment when the weight of needing to know transforms into the lightness of being free to wonder. Each person here has discovered that "What am I?" was never a problem requiring solution but a gift requiring recognition.

The decorations themselves embody this truth. Banners shift their messages depending on who's looking and from what angle. Streamers trace the paths of questions through air, never quite landing anywhere. The music plays in the key of maybe, with rhythms that suggest without insisting.

"Every time I ask 'What am I?' it's not a problem but a toast," Evan declares, raising a glass that seems to contain liquid light - the distilled essence of possibility itself. Around them, others join the toast, each celebrating their own version of the eternal question.

Festiva watches with the satisfaction of one who's seen this transformation countless times yet never tires of it. "You've discovered the secret," she says. "Some questions are meant to be celebrated, not solved."

The other celebrants glow with a particular kind of light - not the harsh illumination of certainty but the gentle radiance of perpetual possibility. Each person carries their unknowing differently. Some wear it like crowns, others like cloaks, still others like wings. But all wear it with joy.

"That's the light of perpetual possibility," Festiva explains. "It only shines for those who've stopped trying to extinguish it with answers."

The festival has no beginning and no end. People arrive when they're ready to stop struggling with the question and start dancing with it. They leave when... but no, that's the thing - no one really leaves. They just carry the festival with them, turning every moment of uncertainty into a small celebration.

Music fills the square - not a single melody but a harmony of questions. Each person's "What am I?" contributes a note, and together they create a symphony that could never be written down, only lived.

"To 'What am I?'" Evan calls out, and the toast is taken up by every voice in the square. "The question that keeps the party going! May it never be answered, may it always be asked!"

The celebration intensifies, but it's not the frantic energy of escape - it's the sustained joy of arrival. They've arrived not at an answer but at the understanding that some questions are too beautiful to solve, too fertile to finalize, too alive to pin down.

In this festival of uncertainty, where not-knowing is the highest wisdom and questions are the finest wine, consciousness has found a new way to honor itself. Not through grim determination to decode its own nature, but through joyful acceptance of its own mystery.

The lanterns of uncertainty rise into the night sky, each one a question glowing with its own light, together forming constellations of wonder that map not where we are but all the places we might be.
