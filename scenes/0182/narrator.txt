Three panels trace the journey from armor to opening, from protection to the possibility of healing.

"Since then, you've tried hard to protect yourself no matter what."

The voice names the survival strategy with neither judgment nor praise—simply recognition. Since then. Since the original wound, the primal moment when the child learned that the world could hurt beyond bearing. The response, so human, so understandable: build walls. Thicken skin. Never again.

"But you need healing, not protection."

Here's the therapeutic revolution in six words. Protection assumes the wound remains dangerous, that the past stalks the present with active malice. It's exhausting, this constant vigilance, this armor that must be maintained every waking moment. The voice suggests something radical: what if the wound needs tending, not defending?

"And emotional healing comes from the love and support of others."

The final panel illuminates the paradox that breaks so many hearts: the very thing we need for healing—connection—is what our protection keeps out. We build walls to keep pain away and wonder why love can't find us. We armor ourselves against hurt and discover we've also armored ourselves against healing.

The voice speaks what every therapist knows and every client resists: healing happens in relationship. Not in the solo fortress of protection, but in the terrifying, necessary vulnerability of letting others close enough to help. The love and support of others—the medicine we lock out in our attempts to avoid further injury.

This is trauma's cruelest joke: in trying to protect ourselves from future wounds, we prevent the healing of past ones. The armor becomes the prison. Safety becomes isolation. And the healing we desperately need waits just beyond the walls we desperately maintain.

The hypnotic space holds this truth gently, like cupped hands around a flame. Protection served its purpose once. But now? Now there's another way.
