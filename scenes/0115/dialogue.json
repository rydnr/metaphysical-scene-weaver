Perhaps consciousness created 'What am I?' to preserve its capacity for wonder, ensuring it never loses the ability to see with fresh eyes. Each asking returns us to that five-year-old state of pure curiosity. The Architect recognizes this makes them not weary philosophers but eternal children playing with existence's biggest mystery—a game that keeps consciousness young forever."
