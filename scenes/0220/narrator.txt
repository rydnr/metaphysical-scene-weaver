The return is as essential as the departure, the integration as crucial as the dissolution.

"After that, the music changed to make me aware that I had to 'go back' to where the session started, and the door did not appear again."

Watch the wisdom of this return. Evan restores his posture and control—not as defeat but as necessary reintegration. The mystical journey that doesn't return to ordinary consciousness becomes spiritual bypassing. The dissolution that doesn't resolve into daily life becomes mere escape.

The music itself becomes guide, changing its rhythm to signal the journey's arc back toward beginning. This isn't regression but completion of the circle. In psychological work, we must venture far to discover what was always near, must lose ourselves to find ourselves, must dissolve to reconstitute with greater wholeness.

"Go back." Not just to where the session started, but to ordinary consciousness, to the ego that needs to function in the world, to the self that pays bills and maintains relationships and navigates daily reality. But now this ordinary self carries within it the memory of dissolution, the knowledge of doors that lead to vanishing.

The door does not appear again. Its work is complete. It showed Evan the possibility of non-existence, gave him the repeated opportunity to practice facing his own dissolution. Whether he walked through or not matters less than that he felt the invitation, tasted the possibility of vanishing. That knowledge now lives in his cells, changing how he inhabits his existence.

The turning around Evan does is both physical and metaphysical. He turns from the extraordinary back toward the ordinary, from the mystical back toward the mundane, from dissolution back toward form. But he turns as someone who has seen the door, felt the vanishing, known the possibility of not being.

This is integration: not clinging to peak experience but allowing it to inform ordinary life. Not trying to live permanently in dissolution but letting its memory season daily existence. Not keeping the door always open but knowing it exists, knowing we could vanish, and choosing instead to be here, present, formed, and aware.

The session ends where it began, but everything has changed. The circle completes, but it's a spiral—we return to the same point at a different level. Evan is back, but he'll never be merely back. He carries the door within him now.
