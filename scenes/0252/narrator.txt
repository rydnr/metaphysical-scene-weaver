The scene shifts back to Evan, carrying all the weight of the architect's wisdom while facing the simple human truth: wanting to understand but not knowing how.

"I would like to dig deeper into the door thing, but I don't really know how."

This confession carries more wisdom than a thousand certain statements. Evan has received the practices—dreamwork, meditation, creative expression, radical honesty. But beneath the techniques lies this more fundamental truth: when facing the truly mysterious, we often simply don't know how to proceed.

The door thing. Even naming it proves difficult. It resists categorization—not quite vision, not quite metaphor, not quite memory. It exists in that liminal space between experience and meaning, between what happened and what it signified. How do you dig deeper into something that exists partially in reality, partially in symbol, partially in the ineffable?

The yearning itself matters. "I would like to dig deeper" acknowledges that the door experience wasn't complete in itself but opened (or failed to open) onto something larger. This isn't spiritual bypassing that claims the experience was enough. This is honest recognition that a threshold was approached but not crossed, that questions were raised but not answered.

"But I don't really know how." Here Evan embodies the authentic position of the seeker—not the false certainty of one who claims to have answers, not the false humility of one who denies the experience, but the genuine uncertainty of one standing before mystery with empty hands.

This not knowing is different from ignorance. It's the learned not-knowing that comes after experiences that shatter our frameworks for understanding. Evan has tried to know through the usual methods. He's been given new methods by the architect. But still, facing the white door in memory, he finds himself without adequate tools.

This is the fertile void where real understanding gestates. Not in the accumulation of methods or the performance of practices, but in this honest admission: I want to understand something that happened to me, something that seems important beyond my ability to articulate why, and I don't know how to proceed.

The door remains closed in memory, holding its secrets. But Evan's honest uncertainty creates its own opening—not through the door but into the space of genuine inquiry where admitting we don't know becomes its own form of knowing.
