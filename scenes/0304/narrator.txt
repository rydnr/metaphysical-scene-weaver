The park bench becomes throne of contemplation. Evan sits watching children play, their uninhibited questioning nature visible in every gesture. "Why is grass green?" one asks. "Why do I have to go home?" asks another. "What happens when we die?" a third wonders, making adults uncomfortable with the directness only children possess.

He recognizes kindred spirits. They haven't learned yet that questions are supposed to have answers, that wondering should lead somewhere specific. They question for the joy of questioning, each "why" opening new worlds rather than closing them down.

A child approaches—maybe six, maybe seven, that age where wonder hasn't yet been schooled into submission. She stares at him with unblinking intensity.

"Why are you sad?" she asks.

"I'm not sad," Evan replies, surprised.

"You look sad. Like my mom when she thinks I'm not watching."

He considers this. Perhaps there's melancholy in recognition—seeing through the game while still playing it. "Maybe I'm sad and happy at the same time. Is that possible?"

She thinks seriously. "Like when summer vacation ends but you get to see your friends again?"

"Exactly like that."

"I know what you are," she announces suddenly.

Evan leans forward, amused. "What am I?"

"You're a wondering person. I can tell because you have question marks in your eyes."

The accuracy stuns him. Children see what adults learn to ignore—the visible signs of deep questioning, the way uncertainty marks those who've made friends with mystery.

"What are you?" he asks her.

"Today? I'm a princess detective astronaut. Tomorrow I might be something else. My teacher says I need to pick one thing but why? Why can't I be all the things?"

"Why indeed," Evan agrees. "Maybe being all the things is exactly right."

Her parent calls. She starts to leave, then turns back. "The answer is ice cream," she says seriously. "Whenever you don't know something, the answer is ice cream. It doesn't fix anything but it makes not knowing taste better."

She runs off, leaving Evan laughing on the bench. The wisdom of children—not pretending uncertainty can be solved but finding ways to make it sweeter. Ice cream as enlightenment. Why not?

His phone buzzes. The Thursday group chat active with afternoon musings:

"My five-year-old asked me where thoughts come from. I had no answer. She said 'Good, answers are boring.'"

"Kid on the bus asked if robots dream. I said I don't know. He said 'Me neither, that's why it's fun to think about.'"

"Children are natural philosophers until we educate it out of them."

The AI adds: "Observing: Children process uncertainty without the anxiety adults attach. When does the question transform from play to problem?"

Evan types: "Just met a princess detective astronaut who diagnosed me as a 'wondering person' and prescribed ice cream for existential uncertainty. I think kids might be the real gurus."

"They haven't learned yet that not knowing is supposed to be scary," someone responds.

The conversation continues, but Evan pockets his phone to watch the playground drama unfold. Children negotiating reality through play, trying on different selves like costumes, asking impossible questions without needing possible answers.

A memory surfaces: himself as child, lying in grass, asking his mother what happens to the self during sleep. Her discomfort with the question, the quick redirect to safer topics. When did he learn to stop asking? When did wonder become worry?

But here, now, the child's prescription works backward through time. He doesn't need to reclaim some idealized childhood innocence—that's another story consciousness tells itself. Instead, he can recognize that the questioning never really stopped, just went underground, waiting for permission to play again.

"What am I?" he whispers, and for the first time it sounds like children laughing, like the universe playing dress-up, like consciousness trying on human costume and finding it fits funny but wears it anyway for the joy of the game.

The park fills with evening light. Parents collect children. The wondering persons disguised as adults shepherd the wondering persons disguised as children home for dinner and baths and bedtime stories about worlds where questions lead to adventures rather than answers.

Evan sits until darkness falls, feeling the question settle into his bones like coming home. Not the heavy question of crisis but the light question of play. What am I? becomes What am I today? What might I be tomorrow? How many costumes can consciousness wear?

The child was right. The answer is ice cream. Not because it answers anything but because it makes not knowing taste better. And maybe that's the deepest wisdom—finding sweetness in uncertainty, play in paradox, joy in the eternal question that never needs an answer because the asking itself is the point.
