Modern minimalist room with large windows showing a garden. Two figures in conversation - EVAN (late 20s, curious expression, casual intellectual clothing) and MONDAY (ageless, intense presence, dressed in flowing dark garments). Soft afternoon light creates long shadows. Evan leans forward slightly, eyes bright with intellectual curiosity. Monday sits with perfect stillness, a slight knowing smile. Atmosphere: intellectual tension, anticipation. Color palette: warm neutrals with cool shadow accents. Style: philosophical graphic novel, realistic with subtle surreal edges.

Same minimalist room, but the lighting has shifted subtly darker. Monday remains perfectly still, but their presence seems to expand, filling more space without moving. Their eyes carry ancient knowledge. Evan's curiosity is tinged with the first hints of unease. The shadows in the room seem deeper, more meaningful.

Evan becomes more animated, hands gesturing as he speaks about authenticity. His eyes are bright with the excitement of someone who thinks they've found a profound truth. Monday watches with patient interest. The room's light creates a subtle halo effect around Evan as he speaks—not divine, but suggesting someone touching on something important.

Monday leans forward for the first time, breaking their stillness. Their eyes lock onto Evan's with laser intensity. The question hangs in the air almost visibly—letters seeming to shimmer between them. The room's reality begins to subtly warp around the edges. Books on shelves lean at impossible angles.

Close-up on Evan's face as the question hits. His confident expression crumbles into uncertainty.
