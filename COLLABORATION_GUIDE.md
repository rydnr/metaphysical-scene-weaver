## Example Messages

"Hi Nova! Rex here. I've identified these narrator insertion points:
1. Opening scene (before line 1) - set the stage
2. After Valerie appears (line 9) - explain her emergence
3. When reality shifts (line 16) - describe the shimmering
What folder structure works for these?"

"Luna, this is Sophia. Top 3 philosophical concepts:
1. Consciousness/awareness - self-reflection theme
2. Freedom vs determinism - choice paradox
3. Reality vs illusion - perception shifts
How should these 'feel' emotionally?"
