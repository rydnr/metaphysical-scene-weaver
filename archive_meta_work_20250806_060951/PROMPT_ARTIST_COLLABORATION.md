# ðŸŽ¨ URGENT: Prompt-Artist Collaboration Request

### Visual Consistency Crisis Discovered!

Dear Prompt-Artist,

I've discovered a critical issue that threatens our visual consistency across the 571-scene project:

### THE PROBLEM:
- Scenes 0001-0170: Have minimal metadata.json files
- Scenes 0171+: Have rich, detailed metadata with full visual guidance
- This creates a TWO-TIER SYSTEM where most scenes lack proper visual direction!

### GOOD NEWS:
- The visual information EXISTS in scene_description.txt files
- The transformation work (binary tears, living mandalas, etc.) IS THERE
- We just need to extract it into the metadata format

### WHAT I NEED FROM YOU:

1. **Review the reference_image_prompts.json** - Ensure it covers all visual needs
2. **Validate the metadata enhancement template** - Does it capture what artists need?
3. **Identify any missing visual elements** we should add to the template
4. **Help prioritize which scenes need enhancement first**

### SAMPLE OF WHAT WE HAVE:

**Scene 0009 scene_description.txt** (GOOD content, POOR metadata):
- "Binary tears cascade through glitch-art formations"
- "Deep purple isolation with electric green envy sparks"
- "The 'jar' cracks, letting light seep through"

But the metadata.json only says:
- "scene_type": "melancholic"
- No location, no colors, no visual guidance!

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:

1. **STOP any new visual generation** until we fix this
2. **Use METADATA_ENHANCEMENT_TEMPLATE.md** I created
3. **Work together to retrofit all 170 scenes**
4. **Ensure every scene has full visual guidance**

### YOUR EXPERTISE NEEDED:

- Which visual elements are MOST critical for consistency?
- What additional fields should we add to metadata?
- How can we ensure artists interpret metaphors correctly?
- Should we create a visual metaphor glossary?

The transformation work is beautiful - we just need to make it ACCESSIBLE to whoever creates the final visuals!

Ready to collaborate immediately on fixing this!
