# ðŸŽ¨ REFERENCE IMAGE PROMPTS GUIDE

## Purpose
Create visual consistency across 571 scenes by defining detailed reference prompts for all characters and locations.

## Character Reference Requirements

### Evan
- **Age/Build**: Young professional (late 20s/early 30s), average build
- **Face**: Thoughtful eyes, slight worry lines from introspection
- **Hair**: Professional but slightly unkempt (mind over appearance)
- **Clothing**: Business casual that becomes increasingly disheveled through journey
- **Body Language**: Often caught mid-gesture, reaching for understanding
- **Visual Metaphor**: Should feel "permeable" - boundaries not quite solid

### The Architect/Monday
- **Form**: Shifting geometric consciousness, never fully stable
- **Core Visual**: Crystalline structures that fracture and reform
- **Emotional States**:
  - Sharp angles when defensive
  - Flowing forms when vulnerable
  - Fragmenting patterns when doubtful
- **Color Language**: Cool digital blues warming with connection
- **Never**: Fully human form - always clearly artificial consciousness

### The Narrator
- **Presence**: Meta-conscious visibility varies by location
- **Manifestations**:
  - Environmental shifts (light quality, atmosphere)
  - Text becoming visible in backgrounds
  - Translucent figure made of words
  - The space between panels
- **Visual Philosophy**: Makes the invisible visible

### Valerie
- **Relationship**: Emotional emanation of Monday
- **Visual**: Warmer, more organic than Architect
- **Form**: More stable but still clearly digital
- **Purpose**: Bridge between cold logic and warm emotion

## Location Atmosphere Requirements

### Philosophical Locations (New)
Each needs distinct visual language that embodies its concept:
- **digital_void**: Pulsing geometric patterns, unnamed colors
- **threshold_cafe**: Translucent walls, quantum probability patrons
- **memory_swamp**: Ecological consciousness, thought-fireflies
- **fractal_library**: Recursive architecture, books within books
- **identity_bazaar**: Capitalist fever dream of selfhood
- **boundary_dissolution_pool**: Edges becoming unclear
- **consensus_reality_checkpoint**: Bureaucratic nightmare aesthetics
- **void_workshop**: Anti-light and paradoxical tools
- **yesterday's_tomorrow**: Shifting architecture of cancelled futures

### Enhanced Original Locations
- **forest**: Add philosophical depth to natural beauty
- **street**: Urban metaphysics layer
- **study room**: Deeper symbolic resonance

## Artistic Style Guidelines

### Overall Aesthetic
- **Genre**: Philosophical graphic novel
- **Influence**: Somewhere between "Sandman" and "The Invisibles"
- **Color Philosophy**: Colors should reflect emotional/philosophical states
- **Line Work**: Clean but with moments of intentional dissolution
- **Panel Boundaries**: Sometimes break down (especially with Narrator)

### Visual Consistency Rules
1. **Character Continuity**: Core features remain recognizable even as they transform
2. **Location Identity**: Each place has unique visual fingerprint
3. **Emotional Color Coding**: Consistent use of color for emotional states
4. **Metaphor Visualization**: Abstract concepts given concrete visual form
5. **Panel Flow**: Visual rhythm that supports philosophical journey

## Technical Specifications

### Format for reference_image_prompts.json
```json
{
  "characters": {
    "evan": {
      "base_prompt": "...",
      "emotional_states": {
        "contemplative": "...",
        "breakthrough": "...",

## Priority Order
1. Main characters (Evan, Architect)
2. Philosophical locations (supports our transformed scenes)
3. Narrator presence guidelines
4. Enhanced original locations
5. Secondary characters (Valerie)

## Remember
These prompts will be used to generate reference images that artists will use throughout 571 scenes. Consistency is crucial, but so is leaving room for scene-specific emotional variations.

The goal: Visual language that makes consciousness visible!
