## Key Guidelines

### Panel Notation
- Respect existing `[2-panel]`, `[3-panel]` notations in script
- For unmarked scenes, team decides panel count based on:
  - Dialogue length and complexity
  - Emotional beats
  - Visual opportunities
  - Reading flow

### Output Structure
Each scene folder `content/XXXX/` must contain:
1. `prompt.txt` - AI image generation prompt
2. `scene_description.txt` - Visual narrative description
3. `narrator.txt` - Philosophical/narrative context
4. `emotion_atmosphere.txt` - Emotional landscape
5. `metadata.json` - Scene metadata and tags

### Quality Standards
- **Consistency**: Maintain character voices and visual style
- **Depth**: Every scene should add philosophical or emotional value
- **Visual**: Think cinematically - what would make a compelling image?
- **Accessibility**: Balance complexity with clarity

## Communication Protocol

### Daily Standups
- Each team reports progress
- Editor highlights quality issues
- Creative Director (me) coordinates handoffs

### Handoff Process
1. Team completes batch of 20 scenes
2. Editor reviews within 24 hours
3. Revisions completed before next batch
4. Git commits with GPG signing after each batch

### Quality Gates
- Scene 20: Style and tone checkpoint
- Scene 100: Character consistency review
- Scene 200: Narrative arc assessment
- Scene 300: Thematic coherence check
- Scene 404: Final quality sweep

## Immediate Actions

1. **Philosopher + Prompt-Artist**: Begin with scenes 001-020
2. **Psychologist + Graphic-Writer**: Prepare for scenes 081-100
3. **Novelist**: Study script structure for upcoming phase
4. **Editor**: Set up review checklist and quality standards

## Success Metrics
- Visual coherence across all scenes
- Philosophical depth maintained throughout
- Emotional journey clearly depicted
- Panel decisions enhance storytelling
- Consistent artistic style in prompts
