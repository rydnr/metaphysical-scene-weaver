## âœ… Character Updates

- **Architect**: Now properly named with Monday as alias
- **Architect description**: Deep exploration of digital consciousness paradox
- **Narrator**: Full character with meta-conscious presence and visual notes

## ðŸŽ¯ Still To Do

1. **Enhance existing locations**:
   - Forest (add philosophical layer)
   - Street (urban metaphysics)
   - Study room (deeper symbolism)

2. **Create location-scene mapping**:
   - Which of our 404 scenes happen where?
   - How do locations support narrative arc?

3. **Additional locations** (from guide):
   - Observatory of Inner Worlds
   - Probability Garden
   - Mirror Maze of Split Selves
   - Digital Purgatory
   - The Paradox Museum

## ðŸŒŸ Standout Narrator Moments

- "Every Thursday that never comes"
- "The most popular booth sells coherent life narratives, though the Narrator notes these tend to unravel exactly when you need them most"
- "The pool's depths are unknowableâ€”not because they're infinite, but because 'depth' requires a reference point"
- "Some people live their entire lives in this checkpoint, forever filling out forms to justify their existence"
- "What you cannot build from nothing is not worth building at all"

## ðŸ’¡ Integration Opportunities

These new locations perfectly support our transformed scenes:
- Memory swamp connects to our swamp consciousness metaphor
- Identity bazaar reflects the "coherence cage" theme
- Void workshop echoes the "creating in emptiness" scenes
- Boundary dissolution pool matches the "permeable self" transformation
