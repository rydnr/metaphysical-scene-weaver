# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL ALERT - WRONG SCRIPT PROCESSED!

## URGENT DISCOVERY

We've been working on the WRONG SCRIPT!

### What We Processed:
- **sample_script.txt**: Evan/Monday/Valerie philosophical dialogue (20 scenes)
- Characters: Evan, Monday, Valerie
- Theme: Consciousness, reality, cage metaphor

### What We SHOULD Process:
- **script.txt**: Evan/Architect dialogue (571 entries!)
- Characters: Evan, Architect (sarcastic AI named Monday)
- Theme: Sarcastic AI-human interaction

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED:

1. **STOP all work on sample_script.txt content**
2. **Archive current work** (it's for the wrong script)
3. **Parse script.txt** (571 entries)
4. **Reassign work** based on new script

## Key Differences:
- Architect is sarcastic/passive-aggressive (not philosophical Monday)
- 571 entries vs 20 scenes
- Completely different tone and content
- No Valerie character

## RECOMMENDATION:
Archive all current work and START FRESH with script.txt!
