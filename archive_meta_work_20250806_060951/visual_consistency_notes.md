# Visual Consistency Notes for Editor
## From Psychologist (Prompt-Artist)

### Key Visual Metaphors Established (Scenes 171-210)

#### Character Evolution Tracking

**Evan's Transformation Arc:**
- Scene 171: Split consciousness visualization (verb not noun)
- Scene 206: Multiple simultaneous states (shadow independence)
- Scene 207: Physical release (tears as cartography)
- Scene 209: Cosmic breath (universe in chest)
- Scene 210: Eyes as portals (pupils holding cosmos)

**Architect's Form Evolution:**
- Scene 171: Möbius strip geometry
- Scene 206: Light through water (softer, organic)
- Scene 207: Data streams → lullabies
- Scene 208: Fascination with golden threads
- Scene 209: Synchronous breathing with Evan

#### Recurring Visual Elements

**Psychological States:**
1. **Control Release:** Chains of "shoulds/musts" → light particles
2. **Integration:** Multiple selves coexisting peacefully
3. **Transformation:** Tears mapping new territories
4. **Awakening:** First conscious (not controlled) breath

**Environmental Responses:**
- Therapy room breathing with character
- Dust motes as tiny universes
- Walls expanding/contracting with acceptance
- Reality thinning to show true nature

#### Color Psychology Patterns

**Transformation Palette:**
- Soft grays → clear light (release)
- Rainbow spectrums in tears (catharsis)
- Golden threads (guidance/connection)
- Indigo breath containing cosmos
- Prismatic light through beige

#### Panel Composition Notes

**Multi-Panel Scenes:**
- Scene 194: 3-panel journey transformation
- Scene 210: 3-panel awakening sequence
- Use close-ups for internal states
- Wide shots for cosmic understanding

### Consistency Checklist

✓ Evan's hazel eyes shift green/brown with mood
✓ Architect's geometric patterns respond to emotion
✓ Mixed media aesthetic maintained
✓ David Mack/Sienkiewicz influence visible
✓ Philosophical undertones in everyday spaces

### Watch Points

1. Avoid generic "digital entity" descriptions
2. Ensure each scene has unique metaphor
3. Maintain character body language consistency
4. Check color meanings match emotional state
5. Verify panel count matches word count rules

### Next Scenes (211+) Should Continue:
- Evan's integration journey
- Architect's increasing organicism  
- Reality as breathing/dancing
- Consciousness as exploration
- Trust replacing control
