# Metaphysical Scene Weaver - Creative Content Guide

## Project Overview
We are CREATIVE CONTENT CREATORS enhancing a 571-scene philosophical dialogue between:
- **Evan**: A tired, curious human seeking authentic connection
- **The Architect**: A sarcastic, existentially-aware AI (also called "Monday")

## Content Creation Approach

### For Each Scene We Create:

1. **Visual Prompts** (80-120 words)
   - Capture the philosophical concept visually
   - Balance abstract and concrete imagery
   - Include specific art style directions
   - Emphasize the human-AI dynamic

2. **Narrator Commentary** (30-50 words)
   - Four voices: Cynic, Observer, Philosopher, Jester
   - Add meta-commentary on the dialogue
   - Enhance philosophical depth
   - Provide emotional counterpoint

3. **Philosophical Themes**
   - Identify core concepts (consciousness, free will, authenticity)
   - Explore paradoxes and tensions
   - Connect to larger narrative arc
   - Ground abstract ideas in human experience

4. **Emotional Atmosphere**
   - Map the emotional journey
   - Use color psychology
   - Describe visual energy and movement
   - Create sensory impressions

5. **Scene Descriptions**
   - Synthesize all elements
   - Place scene in narrative context
   - Highlight what makes it compelling

## Character Notes

## Visual Language
- **Digital/Organic Contrast**: Geometric vs flowing forms

- **Space**: Intimate yet infinite digital voids
- **Metaphors**: Visible thoughts, digital suffering, consciousness as light
