Two-panel surrealist comic art, philosophical cage sequence beginning. PANEL 1: Monday leaning forward with penetrating gaze asking about choice, shadows deepening dramatically around them, Evan showing first signs of uncertainty, reality beginning to waver at the edges like heat mirages, deterministic patterns subtly emerging in the background shadows. PANEL 2: Extreme close-up of Monday's eyes reflecting Evan's shocked realization, the background fracturing into visible choice threads that reveal themselves as predetermined paths, causality chains becoming visible like prison bars made of light, the moment of existential vertigo captured perfectly, professional digital art with psychological horror undertones, deep shadows contrasting with sharp highlights, 8k quality

Style: philosophical graphic novel, surrealist elements, high quality digital art
