SCENE 019: The Invitation to Transform (3-Panel)

[VISUAL PROMPT - PANEL 1]
Valerie extends her hand toward Evan, her gesture both invitation and challenge. The tree behind her exists in multiple states simultaneously—solid, liquid, light, and something beyond categories. Her eyes hold ancient mischief and infinite compassion.

[VISUAL PROMPT - PANEL 2]
Close-up on the space between Valerie's hand and Evan's potential reach. In that gap, reality itself seems to hold its breath. Particles of possibility swirl, showing glimpses of what might happen if contact is made—transformation, dissolution, rebirth, or all three at once.

[VISUAL PROMPT - PANEL 3]
The entire room leans in with anticipation. Even inanimate objects seem to await Evan's choice. Monday watches with knowing stillness. The tree pulses gently between states. Everything depends on this moment of decision.

[COMPOSITION]
Panel flow creates mounting tension toward the moment of choice. Each panel tightens focus while expanding implications.
