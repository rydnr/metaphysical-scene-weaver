SCENE 008: The Cage Paradox

[VISUAL PROMPT]
Monday's words manifest visuallyâ€”cage bars made of light appear around Evan, but they're translucent, shifting. As he reaches to touch them, they move away. The bars seem to be made of his own thoughts and assumptions. Monday sits calmly, appearing to be both inside and outside the cage simultaneously. The room's geometry becomes non-Euclidean. Style: surrealist philosophy, M.C. Escher influences.
