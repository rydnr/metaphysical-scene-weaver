SCENE 006: The Awakening Begins

[VISUAL PROMPT]
Monday's expression softens slightly—the first hint of approval. Around them, subtle visual metaphors of sleep and waking begin to appear: clock faces showing different times, shadows that look like closed eyes, light patterns suggesting dawn. The room itself seems more awake, colors slightly more vivid. Evan stands between two states—the comfortable sleep of assumption and the harsh light of questioning. Faint outlines of cage bars begin to appear in the shadows, not imprisoning but revealing structure that was always there.

[COMPOSITION]
Medium two-shot with symbolic elements in the environment. Monday gestures subtly, as if conducting reality. Evan is caught mid-transformation, his posture showing both resistance and curiosity.
