SCENE 018: The Architecture of Limitation

[VISUAL PROMPT]
Monday's words manifest as actual bricks forming and dissolving around them. Each brick is labeled with a limiting beliefâ€”"solid matter," "linear time," "separate self." As Monday speaks, some bricks crumble, revealing light behind them. The cage from earlier returns but now it's clearly made of these bricks of assumption. Evan watches as his own "impossible" becomes a brick that falls away. Style: philosophical architecture, beliefs as building blocks.

[COMPOSITION]
Monday at center, surrounded by the materialized architecture of limited beliefs. Bricks form and dissolve based on the conversation. Evan observes his own assumptions becoming visible structures that can be dismantled.

Style: philosophical graphic novel, surrealist elements, high quality digital art
