SCENE 017: The Impossible Made Visible

[VISUAL PROMPT]
Evan's face shows the expression of someone whose worldview is cracking in real-time. His eyes reflect the shimmering tree, but also show fractures spreading across his own certainties. Behind him, solid objects in the room begin to show their own subtle instabilitiesâ€”a chair phases slightly, a book's pages turn by themselves. His hands gesture at the tree as if trying to grasp the impossible and make it logical. Style: psychological surrealism, reality vertigo.

[COMPOSITION]
Close-up on Evan's face with the shimmering tree reflected in his wide eyes. The background shows reality becoming increasingly unreliable. His expression captures the exact moment when disbelief gives way to unwanted recognition.

Style: philosophical graphic novel, surrealist elements, high quality digital art
