Psychological surrealist digital art, existential crisis scene, Evan stepping backward defensively with uncertainty written across his face, reality fragmenting around him like shattered mirror showing glimpses of past decisions he thought were his own, Monday's words floating in the air as tangible doubt particles, deterministic patterns creeping into the frame as shadow tendrils revealing the invisible cage of causality, multiple versions of Evan visible in the fragments showing different choice points all leading to this moment, professional digital painting with reality-breaking effects, cool blues and grays dominating with fracture lines of electric white, emphasis on Evan's growing realization and defensive posture, 8k quality

Style: philosophical graphic novel, surrealist elements, high quality digital art
