SCENE 020: The Threshold

[VISUAL PROMPT]
Evan's hand hovers inches from the tree, trembling between realities. His face shows the full weight of the choice—terror and longing in equal measure. The tree seems to pulse gently, inviting yet patient. In his extended hand, we can see both the child reaching for wonder and the adult fearing transformation. Behind him, his shadow shows multiple possible futures based on this choice. The room holds its breath. Style: climactic realism with metaphysical overtones.

[COMPOSITION]
