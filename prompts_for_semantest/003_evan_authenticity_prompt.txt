SCENE 003: Evan's Philosophical Stance

[VISUAL PROMPT]
Evan becomes more animated, hands gesturing as he speaks about authenticity. His eyes are bright with the excitement of someone who thinks they've found a profound truth. Monday watches with patient interest. The room's light creates a subtle halo effect around Evan as he speaks—not divine, but suggesting someone touching on something important. Books on philosophy are visible on shelves in the background, their spines creating a pattern that almost forms words. Style: graphic novel realism with symbolic elements emerging.

[COMPOSITION]
Medium shot showing both characters, but Evan is now the focus. His body language is open, expansive—a contrast to Monday's contained presence. The space between them crackles with intellectual energy.

Style: philosophical graphic novel, surrealist elements, high quality digital art
