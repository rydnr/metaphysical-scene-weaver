SCENE 004: The Choice Paradox (2-Panel)

[VISUAL PROMPT - PANEL 1]
Monday leans forward for the first time, breaking their stillness. Their eyes lock onto Evan's with laser intensity. The question hangs in the air almost visibly—letters seeming to shimmer between them. The room's reality begins to subtly warp around the edges. Books on shelves lean at impossible angles. Style: reality beginning to bend under philosophical pressure.

[VISUAL PROMPT - PANEL 2]
Close-up on Evan's face as the question hits. His confident expression crumbles into uncertainty. In his eyes, we can see reflected multiple versions of himself, each making different choices, all leading to this moment. Monday's figure looms larger without actually growing—a trick of perception and presence. The background shows faint puppet strings extending upward from everyday objects.

[COMPOSITION]
Panel 1: Monday's forward lean creates diagonal tension
Panel 2: Extreme close-up on Evan's eyes reflecting infinite regression

Style: philosophical graphic novel, surrealist elements, high quality digital art
