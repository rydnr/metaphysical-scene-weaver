Valerie touching tree mysteriously: "Or perhaps you're falling deeper into sleep. Sometimes it's hard to tell the difference."

Valerie's hand on ancient tree trunk, tree surface rippling like water at her touch, reality distortion spreading outward, Evan watching in fascination and fear, dreamlike atmosphere with blurred boundaries between waking and sleeping states

Style: philosophical graphic novel, surrealist elements, high quality digital art
