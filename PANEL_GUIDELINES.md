# Panel Guidelines for Metaphysical Scene Weaver

## Understanding Panel Notation

The script uses panel notation to indicate multi-panel scenes:
- `[0007] [2-panel]` = Scene 007 should be split into 2 panels
- `[0009] [3-panel]` = Scene 009 should be split into 3 panels
- No notation = Team must determine appropriate panel count

## Panel Count Guidelines

### 1-Panel Scenes
- Brief exchanges (1-2 short sentences)
- Single emotional beat
- Simple action or reaction

### 2-Panel Scenes  
- Medium-length dialogue
- Action followed by reaction
- Emotional transition
- Character reveal or surprise

### 3-Panel Scenes
- Complex dialogue exchanges
- Multiple emotional beats
- Progressive action sequences
- Building tension or revelation

### 4+ Panel Scenes
- Very long monologues (break for readability)
- Complex action sequences
- Multiple character interactions
- Major plot developments

## How to Write Panel-Aware Content

### For prompt.txt:
When writing image generation prompts for multi-panel scenes:
```
Panel 1: [Description of first panel visuals]
Panel 2: [Description of second panel visuals]
```

### For scene_description.txt:
Break down the action across panels:
```
Panel 1: Evan leans forward, curiosity evident in his expression...
Panel 2: The Architect responds with a sardonic smile, gesturing dismissively...
```

### For narrator.txt:
Consider panel transitions in narrative flow

### For emotion_atmosphere.txt:
Track emotional progression across panels

## Examples from script.txt

**[0007] [2-panel]**: Long sarcastic response needs visual break
**[0009] [2-panel]**: Metaphor setup and punchline
**[0011] [2-panel]**: Contrast between concepts

## Team Responsibilities

1. **Respect existing panel notations** in the script
2. **Determine panel counts** for unmarked scenes based on:
   - Dialogue length
   - Emotional complexity
   - Visual opportunities
   - Reading flow and pacing
3. **Create panel-specific content** in all output files
4. **Maintain consistency** in panel interpretation across team members
