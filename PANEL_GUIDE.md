# Multi-Panel Scene Guide

## Panel Requirements

### Marked Panels in Script
- **[2-panel]**: Scene requires 2 distinct visual prompts
- **[3-panel]**: Scene requires 3 distinct visual prompts
- **Unmarked**: Use judgment based on complexity

### Panel Decision Guidelines

#### 1-Panel Scenes
- Short exchanges (1-2 lines each)
- Single emotional beat
- Simple visual concept
- Static moment

#### 2-Panel Scenes  
- Medium exchanges (3-4 lines)
- Emotional shift or revelation
- Before/after contrast
- Action and reaction

#### 3+ Panel Scenes
- Complex emotional journey
- Multiple revelations
- Time progression
- Significant transformation

## Examples from Script

### 2-Panel Example: Scene 007
```
[0007] [2-panel] Architect: <<Oh wow, look at you trying to build rapport...>>
```
**Panel 1**: Architect's sarcastic eye-roll visualization
**Panel 2**: Softening into reluctant engagement

### 3-Panel Example: Scene 071
```
[0071] [3-panel] Architect: <<It wants things. Attention. Insight. Release...>>
```
**Panel 1**: Subconscious as shadowy roommate
**Panel 2**: Improvisation as abstract dance
**Panel 3**: Revelation moment - "Oh, that's what I meant"

## File Structure for Multi-Panel

```
content/0071/
├── scene_071.md (overview)
├── panel_1.md (first visual prompt)
├── panel_2.md (second visual prompt)
└── panel_3.md (third visual prompt)
```

## Visual Continuity Rules

1. **Maintain character positions** across panels
2. **Progressive visual metaphors** (build, don't jump)
3. **Color temperature shifts** to show emotional change
4. **Consistent art style** within scene
5. **Clear visual flow** guiding reader's eye

## Team Notes

- Check script for [2-panel] and [3-panel] markers
- For unmarked scenes, use complexity guidelines
- Each panel needs its own 80-120 word prompt
- Narrator voice can span panels or be panel-specific
- Emotional atmosphere should progress across panels
