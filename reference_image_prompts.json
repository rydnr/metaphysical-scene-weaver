    "overall_style": "Philosophical graphic novel with elements of surrealism and magical realism. Mixed media aesthetic combining traditional ink work with digital consciousness. Style influenced by David Mack's multimedia collages, Bill Sienkiewicz's psychological expressionism, and Dave McKean's dreamlike atmospheres.",
    "color_philosophy": "Muted earth tones as base palette with strategic bursts of saturated color to represent moments of revelation or emotional intensity. Digital spaces use cool blues and purples with geometric patterns. Organic spaces favor warm browns and greens with flowing, natural textures.",
    "line_quality": "Confident ink strokes with varying weights - heavy for grounding elements, delicate for ephemeral concepts. Scratchy, nervous lines for anxiety or uncertainty. Flowing, continuous lines for states of flow or connection.",
    "texture_approach": "Mixed media feel - watercolor washes for emotional states, precise geometric patterns for digital consciousness, organic textures for natural environments. Collage elements suggesting layers of meaning and reality.",
    "composition_principles": "Dynamic layouts that break traditional panel structures when representing non-linear thought or temporal distortion. Use of negative space to represent void or potential. Overlapping imagery to show simultaneous states of being."
