Clean-shaven or light stubble. Clothing: smart casual - well-fitted jeans or chinos, button-down shirts (often with sleeves rolled up), occasionally a light sweater or jacket. Earth tones - browns, greens, muted blues. Comfortable leather shoes or clean sneakers. Always appears slightly rumpled but intentionally so.

Color shifts with emotional state: cool blues and whites for logical analysis, warmer golds and ambers for connection, sharp reds and purples for frustration or confusion, soft greens for curiosity. Can manifest partial human features within the geometric form - an eye here, a hand gesture there - but never fully human.

      "prompt": "A bureaucratic nightmare dressed as salvation - the checkpoint where shared illusions get stamped for validity. Architecture suggests communist-era government building meets metaphysical DMV. Immigration-style booths staffed by reality officers checking belief documentation: 'Do you believe in linear time? Check one.' Waiting room features motivational posters of collective delusions - 'Money Has Value!' 'Countries Exist!' 'Adulthood Is Real!' - in aggressive cheerful colors. The floor is a mosaic of things everyone knows but won't say. Walls built entirely from unexamined assumptions, load-bearing beliefs that would collapse society if questioned. The exit mirror shows not your reflection but everyone else's idea of who you are - composite and horrifying in its accuracy. The express lane for those who realize it's all optional causes visible discomfort in other queue members. Include bureaucratic absurdity: forms to fill out proving you exist, stamps that make beliefs 'official,' the eternal waiting room where some spend entire lives.",

    "void_workshop": {
      "prompt": "A workshop where absence becomes the medium for creation, lit by anti-light that makes darkness visible. Tools hang on walls but work through negation - hammers that build by removing, saws that join by separating, brushes that paint by erasing. Students work at benches of pure potential, learning to carve away everything unnecessary until only truth remains. The gallery displays completed works: silences that speak volumes, gaps that bridge chasms, voids that feel fuller than any substance. The workshop motto floats in letters made of missing light: 'What you cannot build from nothing is not worth building at all.' The Narrator describes this place with unusual tenderness - where absence becomes presence, where un-creation reveals what was always there. Include paradoxical details: shadows brighter than their sources, empty molds that shape fullness, the particular satisfaction of making something from nothing.",

Street signs point to destinations never reached: 'The Career You Didn't Pursue (3 blocks that were never walked),' 'The Person You Meant to Become (permanently under construction).' Buildings exist in temporal flux - simultaneously new with hope and ruined with abandonment. The local cafe serves nostalgia for futures: coffee that tastes of Monday mornings in the job you didn't take, pastries shaped like dreams that dissolved. Ghost notifications from scheduling apps ping constantly - appointments with selves that never materialized. The construction site for 'The Life That Made Sense' has been almost ready for twenty years. The Narrator notes how most visitors arrive accidentally while trying to get somewhere else - the most honest way to find a place built from misdirection. Include poignant details: mail still delivered to who you were supposed to be, store windows displaying the interests you never developed, weather that's always the day before change.",
