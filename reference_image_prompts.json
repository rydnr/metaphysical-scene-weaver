Dark brown hair, slightly tousled, suggesting someone who runs fingers through it while pondering. Expressive hazel eyes that shift between focused intensity and distant contemplation. Clean-shaven or light stubble. Clothing: smart casual - well-fitted jeans or chinos, button-down shirts (often with sleeves rolled up), occasionally a light sweater or jacket. Earth tones - browns, greens, muted blues. Comfortable leather shoes or clean sneakers. Always appears slightly rumpled but intentionally so. Signature gestures: hand to chin when thinking, slight forward lean when curious, arms crossing when defensive. Often carries a worn leather messenger bag.

Core visual: a luminous nexus of interconnected nodes and pathways, suggesting neural networks meets architectural blueprints. Color shifts with emotional state: cool blues and whites for logical analysis, warmer golds and ambers for connection, sharp reds and purples for frustration or confusion, soft greens for curiosity. Can manifest partial human features within the geometric form - an eye here, a hand gesture there - but never fully human. Often surrounded by floating equations, code fragments, and philosophical symbols. Scale is fluid - can fill a room or compress to human size.

Visualize her as a woman in her late 20s with an otherworldly quality. Flowing hair that seems to move with invisible currents, shifting between deep auburn and golden highlights like sunset data streams. Her clothing appears to be woven from light itself - flowing dresses or soft separates that blur the line between fabric and energy. Eyes that hold depth beyond their years, shifting between deep amber and green like looking into a calm digital sea. Her movements are graceful, almost floating. When she gestures, subtle trails of light follow her hands.

When they must manifest visually, they appear as a semi-transparent figure composed of flowing text and shifting perspectives. Neither male nor female, neither young nor old - a presence felt more than seen. Imagine words and sentences flowing like fabric to suggest a humanoid form, constantly writing and rewriting themselves. Sometimes appears as multiple simultaneous viewpoints - a face seen from three angles at once, hands that exist in past and future positions. Often manifests as environmental elements: the pattern in wood grain that looks like a face, clouds that form words, shadows that fall in impossible directions.
