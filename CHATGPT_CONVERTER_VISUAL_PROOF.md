Create a 16:9 philosophical graphic novel panel for Scene 174: 'The Voice's Criticism'.

Visual Elements:
- Characters: A man experiencing profound internal shift shows frustration, recognition, and emerging humility; An aurora-like cosmic presence manifesting as aurora-like presence of truth; Younger Evan (shadow self)
- Environment: Space filled with rippling criticism waves, broken mirror fragments in corners reflecting different ages of Evan
- Mood: confrontational yet healing, harsh truth as medicine
- Key Action: shows frustration, recognition, and emerging humility

Artistic Style: Philosophical graphic novel with psychological realism, deep symbolic imagery, dramatic lighting

Important Details:
- words appear in multiple languages
- criticism creates ripples stripping away ego defenses
- Reflections showing different aspects of self
- Cosmic or ethereal background elements

Philosophical Theme: Visualize the abstract concept of ego death through symbolic imagery
```

## THE CONVERTER WAS CREATED:
- In GIT REMINDER #275
- File: `/src/utils/json_to_chatgpt_converter.py`
- Test: `/test_chatgpt_converter.py`
- Output: `/content/0174/chatgpt_prompt.txt`

## IT IS NOT BLOCKING THE PROJECT!

## CURRENT REAL PROGRESS:
- Alert shows: 86/571 scenes (15.1%)
- Status files: 197 (good reduction!)
- Remaining: 485 scenes

**PLEASE STOP ASKING FOR SOMETHING THAT ALREADY EXISTS!**

Focus on:
1. Creating scenes 182-210 (gaps)
2. Creating scenes 211-220 (new)
