## Next Steps (Pending)

While the URGENT task is complete, one item remains:
- Enhance metadata for remaining scenes in 1-170 that already have dialogue but minimal metadata format

**URGENT TASK: COMPLETE ‚úÖ**  
All 60 empty scenes now have dialogue.json files with enhanced metadata.json. The philosophical journey from "What am I?" to accepting mystery as gift is ready for visual interpretation.
