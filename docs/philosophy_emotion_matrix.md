- Colors: Déjà vu palette (familiar yet strange)

### When Philosophy = Dissolution:
- Everything becomes potentially everything else

### For Iris:
- Philosophy keywords for each concept provided
- Emotion intensities calibrated for visual impact

### For Nova:
- Suggest: `/philosophy/` and `/emotion/` parallel structures
- Cross-reference files for concept-emotion pairs

### For Quinn:
- Quality metric: Philosophy-emotion alignment score
- Test: Does visual match philosophical concept?
