# Quality Criteria Analysis for Metaphysical Scene Weaver
**From**: Quinn (QA & Testing Lead)  
**To**: Aria (PM) and Team  
**Re**: Script Quality Analysis and Recommendations

## 1. Script Analysis Summary

After reviewing the sample script (entries 0001-0020), I've identified critical quality dimensions for our content generation system.

### Script Format Pattern
```
[ID] [panel-info] Speaker: <<Dialogue>> (stage-directions) [[metadata]]
```

### Key Observations
- **3 distinct characters**: Evan (seeker), Monday (sage), Valerie (mystical)
- **Rich annotations**: Stage directions, metadata tags, panel counts
- **Philosophical depth**: Free will, consciousness, reality, perception
- **Visual elements**: Environmental interactions, character movements

## 2. Quality Criteria for Content Generation

### A. Dialogue Quality Metrics

| Criterion | Weight | Target | Measurement |
|-----------|--------|--------|-------------|
| Philosophical Coherence | 30% | >85% | Concept connectivity score |
| Character Voice Consistency | 25% | >90% | Voice pattern matching |
| Emotional Progression | 20% | >80% | Transition smoothness |
| Dialogue Length | 15% | 20-150 words | Word count validation |
| Metadata Completeness | 10% | >95% | Tag presence check |

### B. Narrative Quality Standards

1. **Scene Coherence**
   - Logical flow between entries
   - Consistent spatial/temporal context
   - Character knowledge continuity

2. **Philosophical Threading**
   - Concepts build upon each other
   - No abrupt topic changes
   - Depth increases progressively

3. **Visual Storytelling**
   - Stage directions support narrative
   - Panel counts match scene complexity
   - Environmental details enhance meaning

## 3. Quality Validation Requirements

### For Folder/Prompt Generator

```python
# Quality checks needed:
- Validate ID sequence continuity
- Ensure speaker consistency
- Check dialogue non-empty
- Verify metadata format
- Validate stage direction relevance
- Ensure philosophical concept presence
```

### For Enriched Content

**Narrator Commentary Quality**:
- Length: 75-200 words
- Must reference philosophical themes
- Professional tone without over-explaining
- Connects to visual elements

**Scene Description Standards**:
- Minimum 3 visual elements
- Atmosphere/mood descriptors
- Symbolic representations
- Character positioning

## 4. Test Cases for Quality Assurance

### Critical Test Scenarios

1. **Empty/Malformed Entries**
   - Missing dialogue
   - Invalid character names
   - Broken ID sequences

2. **Character Consistency**
   - Voice pattern drift
   - Out-of-character responses
   - Knowledge inconsistencies

3. **Philosophical Coherence**
   - Topic jumping
   - Concept contradictions
   - Depth regression

4. **Visual Element Quality**
   - Missing stage directions
   - Inconsistent environments
   - Unclear spatial relationships

## 5. Quality Metrics Dashboard

### Proposed Metrics to Track

1. **Per-Entry Scores**
   - Dialogue quality (0-100)
   - Character consistency (0-100)
   - Visual richness (0-100)

2. **Per-Scene Aggregates**
   - Overall coherence score
   - Philosophical depth rating
   - Emotional arc smoothness

3. **System-Wide Metrics**
   - Average quality score
   - Failure rate by category
   - Processing time per entry

## 6. Recommendations for Team

### Immediate Actions

1. **Implement quality validators** in the processing pipeline
2. **Create test corpus** with edge cases from the script
3. **Define minimum quality thresholds** for each metric
4. **Build quality monitoring** into both programs

### For Semantest Integration

- Validate prompt quality before API calls
- Implement retry logic for low-quality outputs
- Cache high-quality results for reuse
- Monitor API response quality metrics

### Quality Gates Needed

1. **Pre-Generation**: Validate input script format
2. **Post-Generation**: Check output quality scores
3. **Pre-Semantest**: Ensure prompt meets API requirements
4. **Post-Integration**: Verify final output quality

## 7. Edge Cases from Script Analysis

Based on the sample, here are edge cases to handle:

1. **Multi-character scenes** (3+ speakers)
2. **Environmental interactions** (tree rippling)
3. **Meta-commentary** breaking fourth wall
4. **Emotional state transitions** within single entry
5. **Philosophical paradoxes** (clarity as confusion)
6. **Liminal characters** (Valerie's nature)

## 8. Next Steps

1. **Create quality_criteria.json** with threshold definitions
2. **Build validation test suite** for each quality dimension
3. **Implement quality scoring algorithms**
4. **Design quality visualization dashboard**
5. **Establish baseline measurements** from sample script

**Action Required**: Please review and let me know which quality aspects to prioritize. I'm ready to implement validators and tests as soon as tasks are assigned.

@Aria - These quality criteria will ensure professional-grade output. Let me know how this aligns with your project plan.
