# Quinn's Standup Update

## ‚úÖ DONE: What I've completed

1. **Script Analysis Completed**
   - Analyzed all 20 entries in sample_script.txt
   - Identified 3 distinct character voices with patterns
   - Created quality criteria document

2. **Quality Infrastructure Built**
   - Created `src/quality/content_quality_validator.py` with full validation system
   - Built validators for: narrator commentary, scene descriptions, enriched prompts, character consistency
   - Established quality thresholds and scoring algorithms

3. **Collaboration Achieved**
   - Aligned with Luna on emotion shift rates (max 0.3 per entry)
   - Connected with Iris on prompt structure validation
   - Integrated Rex's API format: {entry_id, quality_score, issues[], warnings[]}
   - Reviewed Nova's folder structure for validation points

## ü§ù NEED: What I need from others

1. **From Sophia**: Final list of philosophical concepts to validate (using your 1-4 depth scale)
2. **From Luna**: Confirm character emotional baselines are correct
3. **From Rex**: Example narrator voice categorizations for tone validation
4. **From Nova**: Access to test folder (content/009_valerie_emergence/) for validation testing
5. **From Iris**: 5-10 example prompts in your format for test cases

## ‚û°Ô∏è NEXT: My next steps

1. **Immediate (Next 30 min)**:
   - Create unified test suite incorporating everyone's criteria
   - Implement philosophical consistency validator using Sophia's depth scale
   - Add Iris's prompt layer validation to quality checks

2. **Before 2 PM**:
   - Complete integration tests for full pipeline
   - Create quality dashboard mockup
   - Generate quality report for example scenes

3. **Ready to Deliver**:
   - Comprehensive quality validation system
   - Test suite with edge cases
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Integration with all team components
