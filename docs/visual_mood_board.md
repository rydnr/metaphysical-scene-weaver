# Visual Mood Board: Metaphysical Scene Weaver
*By Luna - Emotion & Visual Mapping Expert*

## Color Palette Evolution

### Opening Palette: "Uncertain Ground"
```
Base:       #E8E8E8 (Neutral gray)
Accent:     #B8D4E3 (Soft blue-gray)  
Warm hint:  #F5E6D3 (Barely-there warmth)
Shadow:     #A9A9A9 (Middle gray)
```
*Clean, minimal, suggesting potential rather than definition*

### Questioning Palette: "Reality Cracks"
```
Cool base:  #6B7C93 (Storm blue)
Doubt:      #4A5568 (Slate gray)
Fear edge:  #2D3748 (Near black)
Hope thread:#FFD700 (Gold thread)
```
*Cooling temperatures as certainty erodes*

### Liminal Palette: "Between Worlds"  
```
Impossible: #9B59B6 (Mystic purple)
Dream:      #3498DB (Deep sky)
Void touch: #1A1A2E (Cosmic dark)
Wonder:     #F39C12 (Amber glow)
```
*Colors that shouldn't exist together*

### Transformation Palette: "All and Nothing"
```
Everything: #FFFFFF (Contains all)
Nothing:    #000000 (Absence)
Between:    #7F8C8D (The gray between)
Becoming:   #E74C3C (Life pulse)
```
*Extremes meeting in paradox*

## Atmospheric Progressions

### Stage 1: Solid Reality
- Sharp shadows, single light source
- Clear edges, defined spaces
- Particles: Normal dust motes
- Fog density: 0%

### Stage 2: Questioning
- Multiple shadow sources appearing
- Edges beginning to soften
- Particles: Thought wisps visible
- Fog density: 20%

### Stage 3: Liminal Emergence
- Shadows casting shadows
- Impossible perspectives
- Particles: Reality fragments
- Fog density: 40%

### Stage 4: Full Fluidity
- No fixed light source
- All edges negotiable
- Particles: Time and possibility
- Fog density: Variable (0-100%)

## Character Visual Signatures

### EVAN - The Questioner
**Color Evolution**: Warm earth → Cool uncertainty → Prismatic possibility
**Particle Aura**: Questions manifesting as golden spirals
**Shadow Behavior**: Single → Multiple → Infinite possibilities

### MONDAY - The Guide  
**Consistent Colors**: Deep blue base with silver wisdom threads
**Particle Aura**: Certainty anchors - small geometric shapes
**Shadow Behavior**: Always casts exactly two shadows (choice/fate)

### VALERIE - The Liminal
**Color Nature**: Iridescent - changes based on viewing angle
**Particle Aura**: Gap particles - things that exist between
**Shadow Behavior**: Sometimes casts light instead of shadow

## Environmental Elements

### The Space
- **Opening**: Gallery? Room? Undefined architectural suggestion
- **Evolution**: Walls breathe, corners multiply, ceiling dissolves
- **Climax**: Non-Euclidean geometry, inside becomes outside

### The Tree (Critical Element)
- **First State**: Hyperreal bark detail, ultimate solidity
- **Touch State**: Water ripples in wood grain
- **Full State**: All possible trees simultaneously

### Light Behavior
1. **Natural**: Single source, realistic physics
2. **Questioning**: Multiple sources, some impossible
3. **Liminal**: Light that casts shadows, shadows that glow
4. **Transcendent**: Omnidirectional, sourceless

## Cinematographic Techniques

### Panel Composition Evolution
1. **Classical**: Rule of thirds, stable horizons
2. **Destabilized**: Dutch angles, breaking frame
3. **Liminal**: Multiple viewpoints in single panel
4. **Transcendent**: Escherian impossibilities

### Focus Techniques
- **Sharp → Selective → Multiple → Omnifocus**
- Use depth of field to show reality's stability
- Impossible focus (near and far simultaneously sharp)

### Movement Visualization
- Gesture trails for emotional intensity
- Time-lapse and freeze simultaneous
- Movement creating reality ripples

## Specific Scene Visualizations

### Valerie's Emergence (Entry 0009)
- She doesn't enter - she crystallizes from existing elements
- Shadows gather and gain substance
- The space between Monday and Evan becomes person-shaped
- Colors: Deep purples and impossible teals

### Tree Transformation (Entry 0016-0017)
- Begin with photographic realism
- Valerie's touch creates water-ripple in bark
- Ripples reveal other tree possibilities within
- Final state: All trees, no tree, the idea of tree

### Evan's Reaching Hand (Entry 0020)
- Hand creates bow wave in reality
- Multiple timeline hands (reaching, not reaching, already touched)
- The space between hand and tree filled with possibility particles
- Colors: Full spectrum contained in the gap

## Particle Effect Library

### Emotion Particles
- **Curiosity**: Golden question marks, spiraling upward
- **Fear**: Sharp black fragments, falling
- **Wonder**: Rainbow motes, expanding outward
- **Confusion**: Swirling gray loops
- **Transcendence**: All colors, no colors, pure light

### Environmental Particles
- **Thought Motes**: Visible thinking process
- **Reality Fragments**: Broken pieces of certainty
- **Time Particles**: Past/future bleeding through
- **Possibility Dust**: What could be glittering

## Integration Notes

### For Iris (Semantest Prompts)
- Each emotional state has specific particle/color/lighting combo
- Can provide exact hex codes and atmosphere descriptions
- Ready to generate panel-specific prompt variations

### For Nova (Folder Structure)
- Suggest: `/moods/`, `/palettes/`, `/particles/` subdirectories
- Version control for emotional evolution
- Metadata includes color temps, fog density, particle types

### For Team Sync
- Visual consistency guide ready
- Emotional atmosphere for each narrator beat defined
- Scene-specific visualization notes complete
