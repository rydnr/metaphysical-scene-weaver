## Narrator Enhancement Strategy

### Narrator Insertion Points
1. **Scene Openings**: Establish setting and atmosphere
2. **Character Introductions**: Provide context and background
3. **Philosophical Moments**: Clarify abstract concepts
4. **Emotional Peaks**: Enhance dramatic tension
5. **Scene Transitions**: Bridge between locations/times
6. **Chapter Endings**: Reflection and foreshadowing

### Narrator Voice Guidelines
- **Tone**: Contemplative, insightful, never intrusive
- **Perspective**: Omniscient but respectful of mystery
- **Style**: Literary quality matching philosophical depth
- **Length**: 2-4 sentences for transitions, 1 paragraph for major scenes

### Example Narrator Enhancement

**Original Script:**
```
[0001] Evan: <<Have you ever noticed how existence tastes?>>
```

**Enhanced with Narrator:**
```
NARRATOR: In the liminal space between dream and waking, where consciousness 
first stirs against the weight of being, two figures meet at the threshold 
of understanding.

[0001] [2-panel] Evan: <<Have you ever noticed how existence tastes?>>

Visual: Close-up of Evan's contemplative face dissolving into abstract 
patterns suggesting synaesthesia, taste becoming color becoming thought.
```
