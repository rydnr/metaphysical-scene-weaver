    "opening": "Valerie's invitation hangs in the air like a bridge between worlds—'Touch the tree yourself.' Not think about it, not analyze it, but TOUCH. Direct knowledge awaiting direct contact...",

    "closing_reflection": "At the threshold of direct experience, all concepts fall away. Only the choice remains: to touch or not to touch."
