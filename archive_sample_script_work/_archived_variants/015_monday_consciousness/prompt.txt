SCENE 015: Consciousness Examining Itself

[VISUAL PROMPT]
The room transforms into a space that defies normal perspective. Walls become transparent, showing infinite rooms beyond, each containing versions of this conversation at different stages. Monday seems to exist in multiple rooms simultaneously. Evan stands at the intersection of several realities. Valerie floats between spaces, her form more ethereal than before. Mirrors appear showing not reflections but thoughts. Style: metaphysical surrealism, reality as malleable concept.

[COMPOSITION]
Multi-layered composition with overlapping realities. Central focus on the three figures, but the environment suggests infinite depth and recursive loops. Visual representation of consciousness observing itself.
