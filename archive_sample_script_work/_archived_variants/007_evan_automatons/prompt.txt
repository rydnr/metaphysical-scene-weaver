SCENE 007: The Freedom Paradox (3-Panel)

[VISUAL PROMPT - PANEL 1]
Evan gestures wildly, frustration evident in every line of his body. His movements create motion blur, suggesting internal chaos. The word "automatons" appears to trigger something—mechanical gears become faintly visible through his clothes, as if revealing the machinery beneath the illusion of self.

[VISUAL PROMPT - PANEL 2]
A moment of stillness as the question hangs in the air. Evan's reflection in a nearby mirror shows him as a marionette, strings extending upward. But in his eyes, there's a spark of something else—defiance? Hope? The beginning of true questioning?

[VISUAL PROMPT - PANEL 3]
The room itself responds to the philosophical tension. Objects begin to show their puppet strings—the chair, the table, even the light fixtures. Everything connected to invisible hands above. But some strings are tangled, some are cut, suggesting the possibility of liberation through understanding.
