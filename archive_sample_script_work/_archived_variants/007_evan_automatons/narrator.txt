SCENE 007: The Desperate Grasp for Agency

[NARRATOR COMMENTARY]
The wild gestures tell the story—Evan is fighting for his sense of self. "Automatons" is a word that threatens everything he believes about his own agency. Watch how his body rebels against the idea even as his mind begins to accept it. This is what philosophical crisis looks like when it moves from head to heart to hands.

The three-panel structure mirrors the three stages of his realization: first, the visceral rejection; second, the horrifying recognition; third, the dawning possibility that understanding the strings might be the beginning of freedom. His frustration isn't really with Monday—it's with the possibility that Monday might be right.

"That freedom is an illusion?" The question mark is crucial. Evan hasn't concluded this; he's terrified it might be true. But in that terror lies the seed of liberation. For as the room reveals its strings, it also reveals that some strings can be cut, some tangled, some rewoven. The puppet who knows it's a puppet is no longer entirely a puppet.
