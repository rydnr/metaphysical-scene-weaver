SCENE 005: Evan's Foundations Shaking

[VISUAL PROMPT]
Evan physically steps back, his body language shifting from confident to defensive. His hands reach out as if trying to grasp something solid, but the air itself seems less substantial. The floor beneath his feet shows hairline cracks spreading outward. His shadow doesn't quite match his movementsâ€”it lags behind slightly, as if even it's uncertain. Monday remains steady, a fixed point in Evan's suddenly unstable world. Style: reality becoming unreliable, surrealist touches increasing.

[COMPOSITION]
Wide shot emphasizing Evan's isolation in space. He's smaller in the frame now, the room seeming larger and less defined at the edges. Monday anchors one corner, solid and unchanging, while Evan floats untethered in the center.
