SCENE 018: The Compassionate Demolition

[NARRATOR COMMENTARY]
"'Impossible' is just another cage." Monday delivers this wisdom without judgment, as one might point out that a door marked "push" actually pulls. The visual manifestation of beliefs as bricks is not metaphorical—this is literally how we build our reality, one assumption at a time.

Notice the phrase "limited experience." Monday isn't dismissing Evan's past, just contextualizing it. Every "impossible" is just a report from someone who hasn't experienced the possible yet. The bricks that form and dissolve show how fluid these limitations really are—solid only as long as we insist on their solidity.

As Evan's own "impossible" becomes a brick and falls away, we see the real teaching: we are both the architects and the prisoners of our own limitations. But what we build, we can unbuild. What we assume, we can question. The cage was always made of our own certainties, and certainty, as it turns out, is optional.
