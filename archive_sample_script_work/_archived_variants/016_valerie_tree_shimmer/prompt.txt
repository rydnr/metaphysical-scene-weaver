SCENE 016: The Reality Shimmer

[VISUAL PROMPT]
Valerie touches a tree visible through the window, and reality ripples outward from the point of contact like water. The tree's solid form wavers between statesâ€”sometimes bark and leaves, sometimes geometric patterns, sometimes pure light. The ripple effect extends into the room, making everything momentarily fluid. Evan watches in fascination and fear. The boundary between inside and outside becomes questionable. Style: reality-bending surrealism, physics as philosophy.

[COMPOSITION]
Focus on Valerie's hand touching the tree, with concentric ripples of reality distortion spreading outward. Evan in the middle distance, caught between wonder and terror. The tree exists in multiple states simultaneously.
