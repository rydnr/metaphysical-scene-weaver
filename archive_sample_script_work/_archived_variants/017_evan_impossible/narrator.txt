SCENE 017: The Last Stand of Logic

[NARRATOR COMMENTARY]
"That's impossible." These might be the most important words Evan speaks. Not because they're true, but because they represent his last attempt to use old tools on a new reality. Watch how he clings to impossibility like a life raft, even as his own eyes show him possibility in action.

The word "impossible" is a boundary marker, a line drawn in the sand of consciousness that says "reality stops here." But the tree's ripple has already crossed that line, and the effect is spreading. Behind Evan, reality is getting ideas. Objects remember they're mostly empty space. Solid matter recalls its wave function.

This is the cliff edge of paradigm shift. Evan can either step back into the comfortable impossibility of his old worldview, or step forward into a reality where trees can shimmer and consciousness can reshape matter. His face shows he knows there's no real choiceâ€”he's already seen too much. You can't unknow what the tree has shown.
