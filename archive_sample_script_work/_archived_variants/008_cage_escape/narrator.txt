SCENE 008: The Teaching Through Paradox

[NARRATOR COMMENTARY]
"You cannot escape a cage you don't know exists." This isn't just clever wordplay—it's the core of Monday's teaching method. Watch how the cage materializes the moment it's named, made of the very recognition of its existence. The paradox is perfect: awareness of the cage is both the problem and the beginning of the solution.

Evan finds himself at the center of a koan made visible. The bars that surround him are his own thoughts about freedom and constraint. Try to escape them, and they multiply. Accept them, and they begin to fade. But Monday's calm presence in multiple locations simultaneously suggests a third option—perhaps the cage and freedom aren't opposites but dance partners.

This is where philosophy stops being academic and becomes experiential. The cage isn't a metaphor anymore. It's Evan's lived reality, and yours too, dear reader. What cages do you inhabit without knowing?
