SCENE 001: The Hook of Uncertainty

[NARRATOR COMMENTARY]
In the space between certainty and doubt, genuine philosophy begins. Watch how Evan's intrigue isn't mere curiosity—it's the first crack in the shell of his assumptions. The introduction he references promises the possibility of disconnection, and this delights rather than disturbs him. This is our first clue that Evan might be ready for what's coming.

Notice how his body leans forward while Monday remains perfectly still. One seeks, one knows. One questions, one has already found the questions behind the questions. This dance will define their interaction—Evan reaching toward understanding, Monday drawing him deeper into uncertainty.

The room itself seems to hold its breath, waiting to see if this seeker is truly prepared to have his reality gently, irrevocably, dismantled.
