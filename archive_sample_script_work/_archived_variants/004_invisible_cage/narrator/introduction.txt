SCENE 004: THE INVISIBLE CAGE
Narrator Voice: Reality Breaker
Philosophical Theme: EPISTEMIC DOUBT / CONSTRAINTS (Level 3)

[OPENING NARRATION - Panel 1]
Watch closely as Monday leans forward—reality holds its breath. In this moment, something fundamental shifts. Not in the room, but in the very fabric of perception itself.

[PHILOSOPHICAL RUPTURE]
"You cannot escape a cage you don't know exists."

The words hang in the air like suspended mathematics, each syllable a key to locks we didn't know were there. What happens when the most dangerous prison is the one we mistake for freedom?

[REALITY DISTORTION - Panel 2]
See how the shadows begin to move independently of their sources? Notice how Evan's reflection shows multiple selves, each one slightly different, each one equally real? This is what happens when certainty cracks—everything you took for granted becomes a question.

[EMOTIONAL CASCADE]
Destabilizing inquiry floods the space between them. Not the comfortable questions of philosophy texts, but the vertigo-inducing realization that the ground itself might be imaginary. Feel how the air thickens with possibility and dread?

[VISUAL METAPHOR]
Transparent walls shimmer at the edge of vision—there, then gone, then there again. Reality ripples where thoughts collide with their own assumptions. The cage isn't built of bars but of beliefs, and those beliefs are starting to show their edges.

[CLOSING PARADOX]
And here's the delicious horror of it all: the moment you see the cage is the moment you're both more trapped and more free than ever before. For now you know what you're dealing with. The question is: what will you do with this terrible gift of sight?
