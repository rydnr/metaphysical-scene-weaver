SCENE 006: The Philosopher's Approval

[NARRATOR COMMENTARY]
"Good." One word that changes everything. This is the first time Monday has offered approval, and it's for Evan's uncertainty, not his cleverness. The teacher has recognized a student who might actually be teachable—not because they have the right answers, but because they've finally found real questions.

Notice how Monday frames the human condition: "sleepwalking through choices, following patterns programmed by circumstance." This isn't condemnation but diagnosis. We are all automatons until we realize we are automatons. The first step toward any kind of freedom is recognizing the chains.

The visual metaphors of sleep and waking that surround this moment aren't decorative—they're instructional. Every unexamined choice is a kind of sleep. Every real question is an alarm clock. And Evan, for perhaps the first time in his life, is beginning to hear the ringing.
