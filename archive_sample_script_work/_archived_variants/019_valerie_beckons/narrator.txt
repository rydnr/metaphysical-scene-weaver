SCENE 019: The Moment Before Everything Changes

[NARRATOR COMMENTARY]
"Touch the tree yourself." This isn't a command but an invitation to direct experience. Valerie offers what Monday's words alone cannot—the chance to know rather than know about. Her beckoning is the universe asking, "Do you want to remain a tourist in reality, or become a participant?"

The three-panel structure captures the weight of this moment. First, the invitation—simple yet profound. Second, the gap where choice lives—that pregnant space between stimulus and response where free will, if it exists, must reside. Third, the cosmic attention—even furniture understands this is a pivotal moment.

"See what happens when you stop believing in solid things." But notice—she doesn't promise what will happen. There's no guarantee of enlightenment or safety. Only the certainty that after touching the tree, Evan's relationship with solidity, with reality, with his own consciousness, will never be quite the same. The question is: is knowing worth the price of never being able to unknow?
