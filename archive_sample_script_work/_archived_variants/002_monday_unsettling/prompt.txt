SCENE 002: Monday's Unsettling Truth

[VISUAL PROMPT]
Same minimalist room, but the lighting has shifted subtly darker. Monday remains perfectly still, but their presence seems to expand, filling more space without moving. Their eyes carry ancient knowledge. Evan's curiosity is tinged with the first hints of unease. The shadows in the room seem deeper, more meaningful. A tea cup on the table between them remains untouched, steam rising in an oddly straight line. Style: philosophical graphic novel with increasing surreal elements. Color palette: cooling, with shadows gaining purple undertones.

[COMPOSITION]
Close-up on Monday's face in the foreground, with Evan slightly blurred in the background. Monday's expression is knowing but not unkindâ€”like a teacher about to reveal a difficult truth.
