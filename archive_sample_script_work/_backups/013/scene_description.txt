SCENE 013: Speaking in Riddles

DIALOGUE:
Monday: "Ah, Valerie. Still speaking in riddles, I see. Don't confuse the boy more than necessary."
Valerie: "Confusion is just clarity wearing a disguise. Besides, Monday, aren't you the one who just shattered his belief in free will?"

VISUAL ELEMENTS:
- Monday and Valerie in a moment of familiar interaction, suggesting history
- Valerie's riddles manifesting as small visual paradoxes around her
- Monday's expression showing both amusement and mild reproach
- The space between them charged with unspoken understanding
- Background showing reality responding to their philosophical sparring

PHILOSOPHICAL THEME: Truth Through Paradox
Sometimes the clearest truth comes wrapped in apparent contradiction - confusion and clarity are not opposites but dance partners.

EMOTIONAL TONE: Playful Profundity
A lighter moment that still carries deep philosophical weight - wisdom delivered with a wink.
