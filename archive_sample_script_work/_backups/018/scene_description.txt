SCENE 018: The Cage of Impossibility

DIALOGUE:
Monday: "'Impossible' is just another cage, Evan. One built from the bricks of limited experience."

VISUAL ELEMENTS:
- Monday gesturing philosophically
- Invisible cage bars becoming visible around Evan
- Bars made of limiting words: "impossible," "can't," "never"
- Valerie in background dissolving similar bars with her presence
- The prison of preconceptions made manifest

PHILOSOPHICAL THEME: Self-Imposed Limitations
Our beliefs about what's impossible create the very boundaries that constrain our experience.

EMOTIONAL TONE: Liberating Insight
The empowering realization that many of our cages are self-constructed and can be self-dissolved.
