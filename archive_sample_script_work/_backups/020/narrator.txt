SCENE 020: Evan Hesitates

[NARRATOR VOICE - Sage/Provocateur]

"Normal" - the most dangerous addiction. But every prison feels like home to those born inside.

[FINAL NARRATOR - Mystic]

And so we leave him at the threshold. Will he touch the tree? Will he remain? The choice - if it is a choice - waits in the space between these words and your next thought.

[NARRATOR NOTES]
- Voice: Blended Sage/Provocateur, then final Mystic
