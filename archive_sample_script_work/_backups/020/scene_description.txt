SCENE 020: The Threshold

DIALOGUE:
Evan: "I... I don't know if I want to. What if I can't come back to normal?"

VISUAL ELEMENTS:
- Evan pulling his hand back slightly, suspended between worlds
- Torn between curiosity and terror
- Old reality pulling him back, new reality beckoning forward
- Monday and Valerie as witness-guardians of this choice
- Crossroads visualized with diverging paths

PHILOSOPHICAL THEME: The Price of Transformation
Every awakening requires leaving something behind - the comfort of "normal" is what we sacrifice for truth.

EMOTIONAL TONE: Suspended Decision
The eternal moment of choice where all possibilities exist simultaneously until action collapses them into one reality.
