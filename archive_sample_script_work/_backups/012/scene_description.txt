SCENE 012: The Tree Touch (CLIMAX - Note: This is actually Scene 019 in the script)

DIALOGUE:
Valerie: "Touch the tree yourself. See what happens when you stop believing in solid things."

VISUAL ELEMENTS:
- THREE PANEL SEQUENCE showing progression:
  Panel 1: Evan's hesitant hand approaching the tree
  Panel 2: The moment of contact - reality rippling outward
  Panel 3: Full transformation - tree and hand merging, boundaries dissolved
- Tree bark flowing like water, wood grain becoming liquid patterns
- Reality waves emanating from the touch point
- Multiple overlapping realities visible in the background
- Evan's face showing the journey from fear through awe to understanding

PHILOSOPHICAL THEME: Reality as Belief
The ultimate demonstration that physical reality is shaped by consciousness - when we stop believing in solidity, matter reveals its true fluid nature.

EMOTIONAL TONE: Awe Mixed with Terror
The sublime emotion of witnessing the impossible become real - simultaneously terrifying and liberating.

SPECIAL NOTES:
- This is the story's climactic moment where philosophy becomes lived experience
- The three panels should show clear progression of transformation
- Each panel deepens the reality dissolution
