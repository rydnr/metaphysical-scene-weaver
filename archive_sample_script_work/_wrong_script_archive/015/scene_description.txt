SCENE 015: Where Consciousness Examines Itself

DIALOGUE:
Monday: "This 'place' is wherever consciousness examines itself. And what's happening is that you're beginning to wake up."

VISUAL ELEMENTS:
- Monday gesturing calmly to ethereal surroundings
- Space shifting between abstract thought and concrete reality
- Evan looking around with growing awareness
- Valerie watching knowingly from the periphery
- Reality bending at edges where thoughts become visible

PHILOSOPHICAL THEME: The Geography of Mind
Consciousness creates its own spaces - we are always in the place where awareness turns to observe itself.

EMOTIONAL TONE: Dawning Understanding
The quiet awe of recognizing that location is a state of mind rather than physical coordinates.
