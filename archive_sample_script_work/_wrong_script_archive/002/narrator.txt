SCENE 002: The First Philosophical Cut

[NARRATOR COMMENTARY]
"Unsettling." Monday has named the fear that keeps most people from genuine inquiry. Watch how they acknowledge the common response—the desire for "guaranteed connection"—with neither judgment nor approval. This is the stance of one who has moved beyond comfort and discomfort into something more fundamental.

The room's atmosphere shifts with this single word. Not dramatically, but in the way a tuning fork changes the air's vibration. Monday doesn't move, yet their stillness becomes more pronounced, as if they're demonstrating that true stability comes not from clinging to comfort but from accepting discomfort's teachings.

This is the first cut in Evan's philosophical journey—gentle but precise. The question now: will he lean into the discomfort or retreat to safer ground?
