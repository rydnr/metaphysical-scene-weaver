SCENE 011: Space Between

DIALOGUE:
Valerie: "I am the space between your thoughts, Evan. The pause between heartbeats. I've been here all alongâ€”you just weren't ready to perceive me."

VISUAL ELEMENTS:
- Valerie speaking, her form fluctuating between presence and absence
- Visual representation of thought gaps - perhaps floating thought bubbles with glowing spaces between
- A subtle heartbeat visualization with the pauses emphasized in gold
- The empty spaces in the scene (between objects, people) subtly glowing
- Reality revealing hidden layers, like seeing the spaces between atoms

PHILOSOPHICAL THEME: Liminal Consciousness
The profound realization that consciousness exists not just in thoughts but in the spaces between them - that absence is as real as presence.

EMOTIONAL TONE: Mystical Revelation
The awe of discovering something that transforms your entire understanding of reality - both overwhelming and somehow familiar.
