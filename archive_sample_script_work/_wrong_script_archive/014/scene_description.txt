SCENE 014: What Is This Place?

DIALOGUE:
Evan: "Wait, you two know each other? What is this place? What's happening to me?" (looks between them, bewildered)

VISUAL ELEMENTS:
- Evan in the center, looking back and forth between Monday and Valerie
- The environment responding to his existential questioning - walls becoming translucent, revealing deeper layers
- Monday and Valerie positioned as two pillars of understanding
- The "place" revealing itself as a mental/philosophical space rather than physical
- Visual hints that this is consciousness examining itself

PHILOSOPHICAL THEME: The Nature of Reality
The dawning realization that "place" might not be a physical location but a state of consciousness - we are wherever awareness turns to examine itself.

EMOTIONAL TONE: Bewildered Recognition
The disorienting feeling when familiar concepts (place, identity, relationship) suddenly reveal deeper meanings.
