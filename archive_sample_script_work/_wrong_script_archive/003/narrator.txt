SCENE 003: The Trap of Clever Words

[NARRATOR COMMENTARY]
Here we see Evan's first philosophical gambit—a clever formulation about authenticity requiring risk. Notice how pleased he is with this insight, how his whole body expands with the confidence of someone who believes they've scored an intellectual point. This is philosophy as sport, ideas as weapons.

But Monday's patient watching suggests something else is at play. Evan speaks of "authentic connection" and "real choice" as if he understands these concepts, but his very certainty reveals he's still operating from the surface. He wields these words like someone who has read about swimming but never felt water.

The philosophical stance he takes—that risk creates meaning—is not wrong. But watch Monday's face. They're waiting for Evan to discover that he's using the master's tools to build the master's house. The real question isn't whether risk makes connection meaningful, but whether Evan himself has ever truly risked anything beyond clever words.
