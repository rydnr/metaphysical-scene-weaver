SCENE 006: The Sleepwalkers

DIALOGUE:
Monday: "Good. Questioning is the first step toward awakening. Most people sleepwalk through their choices, following patterns programmed by circumstance."

VISUAL ELEMENTS:
- Monday nodding with wise satisfaction
- Ghostly figures in background sleepwalking through repetitive patterns
- Evan beginning to perceive the invisible scripts people follow
- Awakening visualized as eyes opening within eyes
- The cage of unconscious patterns becoming visible

PHILOSOPHICAL THEME: Awakening to Determinism
Recognizing that most human behavior follows predictable patterns, yet this recognition itself might be part of the pattern.

EMOTIONAL TONE: Liberating Disillusionment
The paradoxical freedom that comes from seeing one's own lack of freedom.
