SCENE 007: Freedom Illusion (Three Panels)

DIALOGUE:
Panel 1 - Evan: "So you're saying we're all just... automatons?"
Panel 2 - Evan: "That freedom is an illusion?"
Panel 3 - (Visual only - puppet strings revealed)

VISUAL ELEMENTS:
- Panel 1: Evan gesturing wildly with mechanical gears visible beneath his skin
- Panel 2: Close-up of Evan's face, half human half mechanical, "FREEDOM" crumbling
- Panel 3: Wide shot revealing subtle strings on everyone including Monday and Evan
- Recursive imagery of strings controlling strings
- The question of whether awareness itself is scripted

PHILOSOPHICAL THEME: The Puppet Paradox
If we're all following scripts, is the realization of being scripted also part of the script?

EMOTIONAL TONE: Existential Vertigo
The dizzying feeling when even your rebellion might be predetermined.
