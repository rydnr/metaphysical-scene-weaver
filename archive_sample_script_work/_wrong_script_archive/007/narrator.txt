SCENE 007: Evan Questions Automatons (3-panel)

[NARRATOR VOICE - Provocateur]

Even the puppet questioning puppethood dances to the script. Or does awareness cut the strings?

[NARRATOR NOTES]
- Voice: Provocateur (challenging, paradoxical)
- Tone: Playfully dark, questioning the questioner
- Purpose: Meta-commentary on free will even in the act of questioning it
- Visual cue: Puppet strings becoming visible then dissolving
- Panel progression: Strings appear → multiply → begin to fade with awareness
