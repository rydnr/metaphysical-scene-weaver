SCENE 004: The First Reality Crack

[NARRATOR COMMENTARY]
This is the moment the comfortable philosophical debate becomes an existential interrogation. Monday's forward lean is their first physical movement, and it carries the weight of tectonic plates shifting. The question—"was it really YOUR decision?"—is designed not to be answered but to detonate.

Watch how they invoke the meta-level: "when you decided to read this story." Suddenly, Evan isn't just a character discussing philosophy; he's forced to confront his own existence as a character, his choices as potentially scripted. And you, dear reader—when YOU decided to read this, was that choice yours? Or were you always going to arrive at this moment, these words, this question?

The panel structure itself reflects the fracturing—reality splits into multiple frames because a single perspective can no longer contain what's happening. Evan thought he was having a discussion about free will. He's just discovered he might be an example of its absence.
