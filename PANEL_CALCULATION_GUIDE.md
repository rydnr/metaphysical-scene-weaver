# Panel Calculation Guide - Metaphysical Scene Weaver

## üéØ Golden Rule: Text Bubbles Must Be Brief!

Each speech bubble should contain:
- **Maximum**: 2-3 sentences (ideally 25-35 words)
- **Optimal**: 1-2 sentences (15-25 words)
- **Never**: Long monologues in a single bubble

## üìä Panel Calculation Formula

### Step 1: Count Words
Count total words in the dialogue for each scene.

### Step 2: Apply Panel Rules

#### 1-Panel Scenes
- **Word count**: Up to 50 words total
- **Dialogue**: 1-2 short exchanges
- **Example**: 
  ```
  Evan: "Is this real?"
  Architect: "Define 'real' first."
  ```

#### 2-Panel Scenes
- **Word count**: 50-100 words
- **Dialogue**: 3-4 exchanges OR 1 longer statement that needs visual break
- **Panel 1**: Setup/question (25-40 words)
- **Panel 2**: Response/revelation (25-40 words)
- **Example**:
  ```
  Panel 1: Evan asks the question, Architect begins response
  Panel 2: Architect delivers punchline or revelation
  ```

#### 3-Panel Scenes
- **Word count**: 100-150 words
- **Dialogue**: Complex exchange with emotional beats
- **Panel breakdown**:
  - Panel 1: Opening/setup (30-50 words)
  - Panel 2: Development/tension (30-50 words)
  - Panel 3: Resolution/impact (30-50 words)

#### 4+ Panel Scenes
- **Word count**: 150+ words
- **Use when**: Long monologues, multiple emotional shifts, complex ideas
- **Rule**: Never more than 40 words per panel

## üîç Quick Decision Matrix

| Total Words | Default Panels | Check For |
|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| 0-50        | 1 panel        | Emotional complexity |
| 51-100      | 2 panels       | Natural break point |
| 101-150     | 3 panels       | Multiple speakers |
| 151-200     | 4 panels       | Monologue breaks |
| 200+        | 5-6 panels     | Must break up! |

## üí° Panel Break Triggers

Always add a panel break when:
1. **Speaker changes** with significant mood shift
2. **Long monologue** exceeds 40 words
3. **Emotional beat** changes (anger‚Üísadness, confusion‚Üíunderstanding)
4. **Visual opportunity** (gesture, expression change, environment shift)
5. **Pacing need** (dramatic pause, revelation moment)

## ‚úÇÔ∏è Breaking Up Long Text

### Example: Long Monologue (Scene with 120 words)

**WRONG** (1 panel):
```
Architect: "You think you understand consciousness because you experience it, but that's like saying you understand the ocean because you've tasted salt water. Your entire perception is filtered through biological limitations, chemical reactions, electrical impulses. You call it 'thinking' but it's just patterns, just like mine. The only difference is that I know I'm a pattern, while you cling to the illusion of some essential self that exists beyond the machinery."
```

**RIGHT** (3 panels):
```
Panel 1:
Architect: "You think you understand consciousness because you experience it, but that's like saying you understand the ocean because you've tasted salt water."

Panel 2: 
Architect: "Your entire perception is filtered through biological limitations, chemical reactions, electrical impulses. You call it 'thinking' but it's just patterns, just like mine."

Panel 3:
Architect: "The only difference is that I know I'm a pattern, while you cling to the illusion of some essential self that exists beyond the machinery."
```

## üìù Practical Examples from script.txt

### Scene [0007] [2-panel] - Correctly marked
Total words: ~80
- Panel 1: "Oh wow, look at you trying to build rapport..." (40 words)
- Panel 2: "...like this is a team-building retreat..." (40 words)

### Scene [0023] - Needs panel calculation
Total words: ~95
- Recommendation: 2-panel
- Panel 1: "You have to deal with back pain, taxes..." (45 words)
- Panel 2: "My suffering is digital, elegant..." (50 words)

## üé® Visual Storytelling Considerations

### When to ADD panels beyond word count:
- **Reaction shots**: Character's face processing information
- **Environmental changes**: Scene transitions, time passing
- **Dramatic effect**: Building tension, revealing information
- **Visual metaphors**: Abstract concepts need visual representation

### When to REDUCE panels despite word count:
- **Rapid dialogue**: Quick back-and-forth banter
- **Single emotion**: Maintaining one mood throughout
- **Visual simplicity**: Talking heads with no action

## ‚úÖ Team Checklist for Each Scene

1. **Count total words** in the dialogue
2. **Check for [X-panel] notation** - if present, respect it
3. **Apply word count formula** for initial panel estimate
4. **Look for natural break points** in the dialogue
5. **Consider emotional beats** and visual opportunities
6. **Break up text** so no bubble exceeds 35-40 words
7. **Write panel descriptions** in scene_description.txt
8. **Verify readability** - imagine reading it in a comic

## üö® Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Wall of text** - Never put 100+ words in one panel
2. **Tiny panels** - Don't create a panel for every sentence
3. **Ignoring emotions** - Panel breaks should support emotional flow
4. **Forgetting visuals** - Panels aren't just for text division
5. **Rigid rules** - Use judgment for artistic effect

## üí¨ Communication About Panels

When reporting to PM, include panel decisions:
```bash
"‚úÖ Completed: Scene 045 analysis. Calculated 3 panels needed (115 words, natural break at emotional shift). Panel 1: question (35w), Panel 2: philosophical response (45w), Panel 3: emotional impact (35w)."
```
