# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL SCOPE CHANGE - PLEASE READ

## What We're ACTUALLY Building

**NOT**: A generic tool for processing any philosophical script
**YES**: Beautiful, enriched content for the SPECIFIC Evan/Monday/Valerie consciousness dialogue

## New Deliverables

### 1. Content Folders
Create folders for EVERY scene in the script:
```
content/
â”œâ”€â”€ 001/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ prompt.txt      # Enriched visual prompt
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ narrator.txt    # Professional narrator text
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ metadata.json   # Scene details
â”œâ”€â”€ 002/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ... (same structure)
â””â”€â”€ ... (all scenes)
```

### 2. Enriched Content for THIS Story
- Professional narrator commentary before/after dialogue
- Visual descriptions that bring THIS philosophy to life
- Smooth transitions between THESE specific scenes
- Character development for Evan, Monday, and Valerie

### 3. Simple Automation Script
```python
# Just needs to:
1. Read our created prompts from content/00x/
2. Call semantest-chatgpt browser addon
3. Save generated images
```
